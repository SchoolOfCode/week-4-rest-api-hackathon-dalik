The earliest coins are denarii of Mark Antony, struck at his travelling mint in 32-31 BC (RRC 544/8-39). The next coins in the hoard are of Nero (RIC I, 60 and 69), struck after his coin reforms of AD 64, which reduced the silver content of the denarius. Republican and imperial denarii struck before AD 64 do not usually appear in 2nd century coin hoards, because they were withdrawn from circulation during Trajan&rsquo;s reign (AD 98-117), when he initiated coin reforms himself. The hoard terminates with coins from the reign of Marcus Aurelius (AD 161- 180), the last coin of which was struck in AD 168 (RIC III, 191). These coins show very little use-wear suggesting that they had not been in circulation long before being buried. The findspot is quite isolated in terms of known Roman artefacts and sites. The closest site of significance is Carmarthen, the site of the Roman fort and town of Moridunum, approximately 10km to the Northwest. The hoard is the largest extant hoard of Roman denarii known to have been found in Carmarthenshire. Over 200 denarii were discovered in 1692 at Bronyscawen (IARCH-F9BC09), and a hoard of unknown size was found in the early 1800s in Llandeilo (IARCH-C14EF3). A hoard of gold aurei of Hadrian was found in the 1870s near Hermon (IARCH-5BE11E). The current location of these coin hoards is unknown. More recently a group of five denarii was discovered in Manordeilo and Salem Community in 2019-2020 (Treasure Case 21.09). The other Roman hoards known from Carmarthenshire are of later 3rd or 4th century date.",

The Fort was identified by aerial survey in 1956, which revealed ramparts and ditches visible as crop marks. A fieldwalking survey at the site in c. 1983 found early Roman material and a geophysical survey in 2007 discovered buildings within the ramparts (Davies 2007; 2010, 224-6; Dawson 1983).The coins are worn and corroded. All but two of the coins show damage from being in the plough soil. All five of the identifiable coins were struck before Nero&#39;s coin reforms of AD 64. The earliest of the coins are the most worn suggesting that they were in circulation for a longer period of time than the later coins. The two unidentifiable coins (coins 6 and 7) are the most worn of the group. This suggests that these two coins are of relatively early date compared to the least worn coins.&nbsp;",

      "Circumstances of discovery and reportingA hoard of 37 Roman silver coins was discovered by David Henry Moss and Tom Taylor on 20th-21st December 2018 and 19th January 2019 in Caerhun Community, Conwy.The coins were found while metal detecting on cultivated land that was under pasture at the time. The findspot (a National Grid Reference) of the coins and addresses of interested parties are given on the Treasure Receipt Form. The coins were discovered scattered in shallow rocky ploughsoil at depths of approximately 3-4 inches.Mr Moss and Mr Taylor discovered another coin hoard of Roman silver and copper alloy coins in a ceramic pot in an adjacent field (Treasure Case 19.01). They also discovered several Roman bronze artefacts in the same field and neighbouring fields. These artefacts were also handed in for reporting, but they were not considered to be part of the same find as the coin hoards and as such they are not considered to constitute potential Treasure. All the finds were deposited at Wrexham Museum on 7th January 2019 and then transferred to Amgueddfa Cymru on 18th January 2019 for report to H.M. Coroner for North Wales (East and Central) and for further investigation.Description of FindThe hoard consists of 37 Roman denarii dating from 32 BC to AD 221. Most of the coins date from the late 1st century AD to the end of the 2nd century AD. Four of the coins were struck at Mark Antony&rsquo;s travelling mint in 32-31 BC. The last coin in the hoard was struck in AD 221 during the reign of Elagabalus. A summary list of the coins is included at the end of this report.Local contextThe coin hoard was discovered near an apsidal structure which has previously been excavated and tentatively dated to the 3rd century AD.&nbsp;The metal detectorists who found this hoard also discovered a larger hoard of Roman denarii and radiates in a pot, probably buried around AD 270 (Treasure Case 19.01). Several Roman brooches and other artefacts were found in the vicinity. The hoards and artefacts are important supporting evidence for the identification of the building as a religious site and that it dates to the 3rd century. The findspot is around 2.5km North of Canovium Roman fort (NPRN 95640; PRN 662), an auxiliary 1st &ndash; 2nd century fort, which was reoccupied in the late-3rd to 4th century.DiscussionThe coins of Mark Antony&rsquo;s travelling mint contained less silver than contemporary coins, so they remained in circulation after Nero&rsquo;s coin reforms and the subsequent removal of pre-Neronian denarii from circulation. Their presence in a late denarius hoard like this is therefore not unusual. The last datable coin in the hoard is a denarius of Elagabalus&rsquo;s Series 4d (TR P IIII) which gives the hoard a terminus post quem (earliest possible date of deposition) of AD 221.&nbsp;Metal contentImperial silver denarii of the first to third century AD vary in fineness from greater than 90% silver by weight in the first century to about 50% silver in the early third century.Treasure Act considerationsAs two or more silver (&gt;10% Ag) coins over 300 years old when found, the 37 denarii qualify as Treasure if they were originally associated in the ground. All the coins represented in this group are known to have been in circulation at the same time. Coin hoards with similar compositions have been reported from across England and Wales. The earlier coins of the group, especially the denarii of Mark Antony and, to a lesser extent, the Flavian coins are more worn than the later coins, indicating that they had been in circulation for a long time when they were buried. The close concentration of coins is a good indication that they were deposited together, as is the lack of smaller denomination coins, which you would expect to be included among site finds. On a balance of probability, it is likely that they were deposited together on a single occasion.Summary list by ruler:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark Antony (coins dated 32-31 BC)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVespasian (AD 69-79)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp; Titus Caesar\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTitus (AD 79-81)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNerva (AD 96-8)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrajan (AD 98-117)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHadrian (AD 117-38)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp; Sabina\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAntoninus Pius (AD 138-61)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp; Diva Faustina I\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Aurelius (AD 161-80)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucius Verus\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp; Faustina II under Marcus\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCommodus (AD 180-192)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp; Divus Marcus\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWars of the Succession (AD 193-198)\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp; Septimius Severus\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp; Julia Domna\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElagabalus (AD 218-222)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain Emperor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t37",

      "Circumstances of discovery and reportingA ceramic pot containing 2733 Roman silver and copper alloy coins was discovered by David Henry Moss and Tom Taylor on 22nd December 2018 in Caerhun Community, Conwy.&nbsp;The hoard was found while metal detecting on cultivated land that was under pasture at the time. The top of the pot was discovered at a depth of about 30cm below the surface of the field, at the top of a slight mound. The finders carefully excavated the pot themselves, wrapped the pot in bandages and left the coins inside the pot. The rim of the pot had been struck by a plough at some point in the past, resulting in several potsherds and a few of the coins being scattered. These fragments and loose coins were also recovered by the finders. The findspot (a National Grid Reference) of the pot and addresses of interested parties are given on the Treasure Receipt form.&nbsp;Mr Moss and Mr Taylor discovered another coin hoard of Roman silver coins in an adjacent field, which is being reported on separately (Treasure Case 19.03). They also discovered several Roman bronze artefacts in the same field and neighbouring fields. These artefacts were also handed in for reporting, but they were not considered to be part of the same find as the coin hoards and as such they are not considered to constitute potential Treasure. All the finds were deposited at Wrexham Museum on 7th January 2019 and then transferred to Amgueddfa Cymru on 18th January 2019 for report to H.M. Coroner for North Wales (East and Central) and for further investigation.Further investigationThe hoard was of immediate interest because traces of leather bags holding the coins could be seen at the top of the pot. Amgueddfa Cymru &ndash; Museum Wales began discussions with TWI Technology Centre (Wales) in Port Talbot to get the pot CT-scanned before the coins were removed from the pot. These discussions were put on hold during the first COVID-19 lockdown, when access to the museum was limited and staff were placed on furlough. In August 2021, Louise Mumford (Senior Conservator: Archaeology) and Alastair Willis (Senior Curator: Numismatics and the Welsh Economy) took the hoard to TWI for CT-scanning. The hope was that the CT-scans would reveal the layout of the coins within the pot and show any possible bags of coins that were not visible at the top. The CT-scan showed the layout of coins near the edges of the pot, but the coins were packed so densely that the CT-scanner could not penetrate through the centre of the pot. From what was visible, there was no clear evidence that there were further bags in the pot.Following the CT scan, Louise Mumford micro-excavated the coins from the pot, initially removing the two bags and then excavating the coins in layers (&ldquo;spits&rdquo;) divided into quadrants. As each bag and spit was removed, 3D scans and photographs were taken of the pot, both to act as a record of the excavation and for further research and interpretation. The coins were then sorted by the ruler depicted on their obverses, in order to determine the likely deposition date and the date range of the coins in the hoard.Description of FindA coin hoard comprising a ceramic vessel containing 2,733 silver and copper alloy Roman coins: 326 denarii &nbsp;and 2407 radiates . The coins range in date from 32 BC to AD c.270 and represent 49 different rulers. Most of the coins appear to have been placed loose in the pot, but 405 of them, all silver and mostly earlier coins up to AD 250, were held in two leather bags. These leather bags were positioned on top of the other coins. The leather has partially survived, an extremely rare occurrence in British archaeological contexts.&nbsp;Bag 1: The coins in Bag 1 consist of 39 denarii and 89 radiates. The earliest denarii are those struck at Mark Antony&rsquo;s travelling mint in 32-31 BC while the latest was struck during the reign of Alexander Severus (AD 222-235). The first radiates in the bag are from Caracalla&rsquo;s reign as senior emperor (AD 211-217) and were first struck in AD 215. The last radiates are two of Postumus (AD 260-269).Bag 2: The coins in Bag 2 almost exclusively consisted of denarii. The only exceptions are a silver radiate of Gordian III, struck in AD 241-243, and an unidentified radiate. The denarii range in date from 32 BC (Mark Antony) to AD 217 during the reign of Caracalla.&nbsp;An additional 10 coins were removed from the soil in the top of the pot before Bags 1 and 2 were identified. These included three denarii dating to AD 69-117 and seven radiates dating to AD 238-260. Most of these were probably held in the bags but were displaced when the pot was struck by the plough.&nbsp;Rest of the hoard: The coins filling the rest of the pot comprise five denarii of Alexander Severus (AD 222-235) and his mother Julia Mamaea, and 2296 radiates beginning with 83 radiates of Gordian III (AD 238-244) and ending with three radiates of Quintillus (AD 270) and 73 radiates of Victorinus (AD 269-271). Coins of Postumus (AD 260-269) form the largest portion of the radiates (1087 coins). The coins were extracted from the pot a layer at a time. The composition of the coins in each layer has been recorded and there are some small differences between the layers. A higher proportion of the coins in the uppermost layer are later in date (e.g. Victorinus and Quintillus) than in the lower layers and a higher proportion of the coins in the lowest layers are of earlier date (e.g. Gordian III). Coins of Postumus are present in large numbers in each level.&nbsp;Coins out of context: Some coins were found outside of the pot by the finders. These had been scattered by ploughing which had removed the top of the pot. There were also several coins which dropped out of cracks in the bottom of the pot on one occasion while the hoard was being manoeuvred. These comprise eighteen radiates of the same types as those found elsewhere in the hoard.The vessel: The hoard was in a pottery container, a Severn Valley Ware jar in orange-buff with a grey core. The rim is of the &lsquo;pulley&rsquo; type, a double rim which in this case has a lower rim which is frilled and with a cordon at the shoulder-neck junction. Severn Valley Ware is a regional fabric produced at several centres through the Severn Basin and marketed well beyond that. It appears at Chester by the late first century and later along the North Wales coast reaching Segontium in the Hadrianic-Antonine period at the earliest (and possibly not until the third century). Pulley rims in Severn Valley Ware are generally third or fourth century but more precisely datable examples either of the plain or frilled types are scarcer. Parallels are known from late-3rd century contexts at Whitchurch, Brockworth and Wroxeter. A third century date for our jar would, therefore, seem probable, but by no means certain. One can suggest, however, that the vessel was probably not the original container for the earlier parts of the hoard, but could well have served for much of the main collecting period. (Vessel description written by Peter Webster)Local ContextThe coin hoard was discovered near an apsidal structure which has previously been excavated&nbsp;and tentatively dated to the 3rd century AD. The metal detectorists who found this hoard also discovered a smaller coin hoard of 37 Roman silver denarii nearby, probably buried around AD 220 (Treasure Case 19.03). Several Roman brooches and other artefacts were found in the vicinity. The hoards and artefacts are important supporting evidence for the identification of the building as a religious site and that it dates to the 3rd century. The findspot is around 2.5km North of Canovium Roman fort (NPRN 95640; PRN 662), an auxiliary 1st &ndash; 2nd century fort, which was reoccupied in the late-3rd to 4th century.Wider context and discussionThe radiates in the hoard were issued during a period known as the Crisis of the Third Century (AD 235-284), which was characterised by a succession of short-reigned emperors, political turmoil, civil wars, barbarian incursions and hyperinflation. In AD 260, Gaul, Britannia, Germania and Hispania broke away from the rest of the Roman Empire to form the Gallic Empire under Postumus (AD 260-269), the former governor of Germania. The Gallic Empire&rsquo;s institutions mirrored those of Rome and it issued its own coinage. It was finally reabsorbed into the Central Roman Empire in AD 274. Two of the Gallic emperors are represented in the hoard: Postumus (AD 260-269) and Victorinus (AD 269-271). Both Victorinus and his successor Tetricus I issued very large numbers of radiates, but only 71 of Victorinus&rsquo; radiates and none of Tetricus&rsquo; are represented in the hoard, indicating that the hoard was probably buried during Victorinus&rsquo; reign.The three coins of Quintillus give a terminus post quem (earliest possible date of deposition) of AD 270. Brother of his predecessor Claudius II Gothicus (AD 268-270), Quintillus only reigned for a few months before being overthrown by Aurelian. Victorinus ruled in Gaul, Germania and Britain in AD 269-271.&nbsp;The separation of the silver denarii and earlier silver radiates into the two bags is significant. Such divisions, by metal and denomination are known from other coin hoards, such as the Beau Street coin hoard from Bath (IARCH-F3D646). They could indicate accumulation and sorting of the silver coins in another location before they were placed in the pot. The differences in the composition of different layers within the pot may also be significant. Internal stratification like this is also seen in coin hoards, such as the Frome I coin hoard (IARCH-ED5662). The positioning of the latest coins in the hoard near the top of the pot, and the earliest near the bottom (ignoring the contents of the two bags) suggests that the unbagged coins may have been added to the pot on multiple occasions or over a period of time. The presence of coins of Postumus throughout the hoard, though, indicates that the accumulation in the of the non-bagged coins would not have occurred before AD 260.Metal contentImperial silver denarii of the first to third century AD vary in fineness from greater than 90% silver by weight in the first century to about 50% silver in the early third century. Radiates contain about 50% silver when introduced in AD 215 but are debased to around 1-2% silver in c. AD 270.Summary list of coins arranged by ruler and denomination:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRuler\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDenarii\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRadiates\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMark Antony (32-31 BC)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t33\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t33\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugustus (27 BC-AD 14)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNero (AD 54-68)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGalba (AD 68-69)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOtho (AD 69)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVitellius (AD 69)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVespasian/Titus (AD 69-81)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t67\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t67\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDomitian (AD 81-96)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t10\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNerva (AD 96-98)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrajan (AD 98-117)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t41\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t41\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHadrian (AD 117-138)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t33\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\t\t\t\t\t\t33\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

As the coins were contained in a ceramic vessel, they were clearly buried together at the same time.Recommendation&nbsp;It is my opinion that these coins and their ceramic container qualify as Treasure under Section 1(1)(a)(ii) of the Treasure Act 1996 (see The Treasure Act 1996 Code of Practice (2nd Revision 2003), paragraphs 7, 14 and 15).Declaration of InterestLlandudno Museum (supported by Conwy Culture Centre) and Amgueddfa Cymru have expressed interest in acquiring the hoard.&nbsp;AbbreviationsIARCH &ndash; Iron Age and Roman Coin Hoards project, Crisis or continuity: Hoarding in the Iron Age and Roman Britain with special reference to the third century AD.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

This addenda of two further coins brings the total now to 34. Of the these, Twenty Roman silver coins were found by Len Jackman between 28th January and 13th February 2019 in an area of 20-30 feet, with several being close together, indicative of a plough-scattered hoard. This case was submitted as treasure cases 2109 T157. Between the 9th and 20th of April 2022 a further 12 siliquae were found within the vicinity of these coins. This case was submitted as 2022 T386. &nbsp;Between February and March 2023 two further coins were found in this same field and will now be considered below.Description of findThe coins are both of the main silver denomination of the late Roman period, the siliqua, and both were issued by Magnus Maximus at the mint of Trier c. AD 383-8.Siliquae were among the last silver coins minted in the western Roman cities of the Roman Empire in the late fourth and early fifth century but continued to circulate after collapse of Roman rule over Britain in AD 410.

      "Description:&nbsp; A small scattered coin hoard of two Roman denarii found only one or two steps away from one another on the same day while metal detecting.The coins include:1.

TThickness: 2.0mm Weight: 3.14 grams Diameter: 17.4mm. Die axis:6 o&rsquo;clockDiscussion:&nbsp; The two coins are the same denomination but separated by almost 100 years in their date of minting. However, their close proximity may suggest these were buried at the same time. Coins of this type are known to circulate into the first and second century AD in Britain (and coins of Mark Antony have been found in third century AD hoards). There are certainly coin hoards which contain both type of coin recorded on the database such as NMS-A6F891 (2016T789) and LEIC-A67FAF (2015T457). As such there is precedent for these coins to have been deposited together.Conclusion: Each of the coins are more than 10% silver. It is probable they were deposited together as a group, deliberately or accidentally, on a single occasion in the late the 1st century BC century or later. The coins therefore fulfil the criteria of Treasure according to the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.",

      "This report will consider these coins with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure Act (1996):&nbsp; Namely, their age, precious metal content and whether the coins can be said to come from the same find.Circumstances of find The 18 coins in question were found on the 7th of March 2022 by a metal-detector user. The discovery was made close to the findspot of two coin hoards found 6.5m apart (Stoke Lyne I, 2016 T753 and Stoke Lyne II, 2016 T756, PAS BERK-2C9948 and BERK-A39DED respectively) both consisting of Roman radiates. A hoard of Roman denarii from the same parish currently going through the Treasure process was not found at this location and cannot be considered a related deposit.The coinsThe coins in the hoard are all of the denomination commonly referred to as a radiate and date from the joint reign Valerian and Gallienus (AD 253-260) to the reign of the Gallic emperor Victorinus (AD 269-71). The hoard is made up of the debased copper alloy coinage issued in large quantities under the Gallic empire (AD 260-274).Summary:Radiates&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central empireValerian and Gallienus, AD 253-260&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salonina&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1Gallienus, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AD 260-68&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Salonina&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1Claudius II, AD 268-70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2Gallic empirePostumus, AD 260-9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6Victorinus, AD 269-71&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18DiscussionThe Stoke Lyne I hoard contained1691 radiates up to the reign of the Tetrici (AD 274) or later, as well as earlier coins of the rulers represented in this group. The hoard had been buried in a ceramic vessel that had been struck by the plough, scattering its contents, with only about 50% of the vessel surviving intact. Stoke Lyne II (containing 395 radiates) was of a similar date but the latest coins were of Postumus and Victorinus (as is the case in the small sample of coins listed here). It had also been contained in a vessel since broken by the plough and it is not possible to determine whether the two pots were buried at the same time or separately (the discoveries are clearly related). The catalogue for hoard II also included c. 193 stray coins from these two finds that could not be attributed to a specific hoard. It is likely that these coins are additional plough scatter from these hoards.RecommendationI conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996 by being bronze coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and of one find of more than ten pieces, and as addenda to the earlier find(s) 2016 T753 and 2016 T756.",

      "This report will consider these coins with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure Act (1996):&nbsp; Namely, their age, precious metal content and whether the coins can be said to come from the same find.Circumstances of findThirteen Roman silver coins were found by Len Jackman between 11th of April 2021 and the 2nd of February 2022 in an area of c.90m feet, with several being close together, indicative of a plough-scattered hoard. Three silver coins were found over a period of 4 months and reported individually to the Finds Liaison officer followed by a further 10 leading the finder to consider the case was a dispersed hoard.Description of findThe coins are all of the main silver denomination of the late Roman period, the siliqua. Siliquae were among the last silver coins minted in the western Roman cities of the Roman Empire in the late fourth and early fifth century but continued to circulate after collapse of Roman rule over Britain in AD 410. Most of the coins in the hoard appear to be very lightly clipped to remove silver from the edges of the coins. This is in keeping with the relatively early date of the hoard (tpq. c. AD 375-8).Summary by mint and date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trier Lyon Arles Aquileia Unc.

The coins date from the late first to late second century (earliest coin AD 69, latest coin issued c. AD 174-5) and are of types that circulated and were hoarded together.A number of other Roman coins have been reported from a radius of 0.5km from the findspot, including a few worn base metal coins of 2nd century in date (their high degree of wear suggests that they were not deposited as a group with these mainly earlier denarii). In the absence of the base metal coins of the 3rd to 4th centuries that are usually to be found on Romano-British settlement sites, the 25 silver coins are best explained as a small associated group, rather than casual losses.Five further silver coins dating from the Roman Republic to the reign of Antoninus Pius were found in the same field (PAS records created from September 2019 to October 2021: BERK-86C534, OXON-3E61B2, BERK-88DF9D, BERK-87346E, BERK-E2AC0F) and are likely to belong to this group, but were not recognised as potential Treasure at the time of discovery.Recommendation These coins appear to qualify as Treasure under the 1996 Act because they are two or more precious metal coins which are more than 300 years old and believed to be from a single dispersed deposit.",

It may be that the coins here constitute two or more groups, with coins 1-2 in one and the third century coins in another. In the absence of archaeological context it is not possible to say to which of these two groups coins 3 to 5 are likely to have belonged, but it is at least likely that all of the 10 coins could have been deposited together in two or more groups.Conclusion: All the coins detailed above are more than 300 years old and have a precious metal (silver) component of greater than the 10% minimum required by the Treasure Act. Consequently, the coins in this find constitute Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996) by being a group of two or more precious metal coins of the same find.",

      "TREASURE CASE : 2021 T488The coinsThe coins submitted for consideration consist of 40 silver and 43 base metal coins. Some of the silver coins were fragmentary and in two instances, separately bagged halves were found to join, giving a total of 38 silver coins (a total of 81 coins).The copper alloy coins are mainly of the denomination known as the sestertius, possibly with a few fractions (dupondius or as). Many of the sestertii are stuck together, obscuring the inner faces of the coin and most of the remainder are worn or corroded with some loss of surfaces. The silver coins are also worn and in some cases the design has been obscured by corrosion.As is often the case with second century mixed denomination hoards, the silver portion appears to have a slightly earlier terminal date than the base metal coins, with the latest legible denarii issued during the reign of Antoninus Pius, to AD 156-7 and possibly up to AD 161. The hoard cannot be dated precisely due to the number of illegible coins but there is a single coin of Marcus Aurelius as emperor (reigned AD 161-180).The coins are fully catalogued in the appendix below but can be summarised by reign as:Summary:Summary:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRuler\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDenarii\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSestertii and fractions\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRepublic (Mark Antony 32-31 BC)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVespasian (AD 69&ndash;79)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDomitian (AD 81&ndash;96)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain Flavian (AD 69&ndash;98)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNerva\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrajan (AD 98&ndash;117)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHadrian (AD 117-138)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sabina\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAntoninus Pius (AD 138-161)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcus Aurelius Caesar\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faustina I\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diva Faustina I\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Aurelius (AD 161-180)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain Antonine emperor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain Ruler\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t27\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t38\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t43\t\t\t\t\t\tThe objectsThe artefacts submitted with the hoard include two iron nails of indeterminate date and a copper alloy vessel rim fragment (no. 32) (apparently recorded on the Treasure receipt as a ceramic vessel fragment in error).Copper alloy vessel rim sherd. 13.15g 38.8mm w., 21.0 mm h., 4.3mm thick.

      "Hoard of 392 silver coins and a ceramic vessel (summary extracted from full catalogue by E. Ghey below)The coinsThe hoard consists of 374 coins (two of which plated) found in the main hoard and 18 coins (one of which plated) found in the dispersed group. The coins in the hoard are all silver Roman denarii, with the exception of one drachm of Trajan minted in Lycia. This is likely to have circulated as a denarius, being of the same superficial appearance. The earliest coins in the hoard are Republican Roman denarii issued in 32&ndash;1 BC by Mark Antony and the latest issued during the joint reign of Septimius Severus and Caracalla. The latest dated coins were issued in AD 201, though there were other more broadly dated coins of Julia Domna (traditionally dated up to AD 211) and Geta as Caesar, (dated to AD 199-204). The latest coins are unworn in appearance and are unlikely to have circulated much if at all; it is likely therefore that the hoard was deposited sometime after AD 201. A number of plated forgeries (plated coins) are present; one has a very thick layer of plated metal and it is likely that further forgeries exist in the group but cannot be determined without further analysis. The forgeries have been included in the main catalogue, noted where applicable. The presence of forgeries in the Severan circulation pool is well documented. The potteryThe pottery container requires cleaning and examination by a local expert but consists of two base sherds and 39 upper body sherds of a Roman grey-ware vessel, perhaps a small jar with pedestal base and plain rim. The sherds appear to come from the same vessel and may constitute a more or less complete pot. The external diameter of the base is 57.8mm. Traces of dark organic material (a burnt residue?) appear on the base and on the interior of some of the sherds, but there is no copper alloy staining in the vessel.",

      "This report will consider these coins with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure Act (1996):&nbsp; Namely, their age, precious metal content and whether the coins can be said to come from the same find.Circumstances of findTwo Roman coins were found by metal-detector user Anderson Ferriera. The first coin was found on the 9th of May 2020 and the second, over a year later, on the 28th of May 2021. The coins were recovered from the plough soil through the use of a metal detector and separated by a distance of 19m. The land has been subsoiled and ploughed in the past.The first coin was reported to the Finds Liaison Officer for Oxfordshire and recorded with the Portable Antiquities Scheme in 2020 (PAS ID: OXON-0AC553). The second was reported to the Finds Liaison Officer in 2021, where upon it was decided the finds may constitute a scattered hoard (PAS ID: OXON-7551A7). Upon consultation with the finder it was decided that both coins would be submitted as a single case rather than only the second coin being submitted.Description of findThe hoard consists of 2 silver late Roman siliquae. The siliqua was the main silver denomination of the late Roman period. These were among the last silver coins minted in the western Roman cities of the Roman Empire in the late fourth and early fifth century but continued to circulate after the collapse of Roman rule over Britain in AD 410.The coins listed span the period&nbsp;AD&nbsp;388&ndash;402, ending, as is common with hoards of this date, with a siliqua of Honorius dated to AD 395&ndash;402. Both of the coins have been clipped.Summary of late Roman coins by mint and date:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIssue date\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrier\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMilan\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t388&ndash;395\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t395&ndash;402\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom the same find?It is likely that these coins were all withdrawn from the same pool of circulation in the early fifth century AD and deposited together. The circumstances of discovery also indicate a scattered hoard.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of Treasure by being silver coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and of one find of more than two coins.Dr. Edward CaswellFinds Liaison Officer for OxfordshireJune 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CATALOGUENote: Clipping factor (from 0 to 4) indicated under CF.

      "A late third century base metal hoard.The coins in the hoard are all but one of the denomination commonly referred to as a radiate and date from the joint reign of Valerian and Gallienus (AD 253&ndash;260) to the reign of the usurper Carausius in Britain (AD 286&ndash;293). The bulk of the hoard is made up of the debased copper alloy coinage issued in large quantities under the Gallic empire (AD 260&ndash;274) and higher silver content post AD 274 reformed radiates are poorly represented. The hoard contains a number of unofficial copies that could post-date AD 274 but cannot be closely dated; they are mostly of standard sized module and no prototypes later than this date could be identified. A single fourth century base metal nummus (AD 335-341) is present, presumably a stray find from the surrounding soil.

      "The coins submitted for consideration consist of a group 52 copper alloy coins, most of which were severely corroded, worn or otherwise illegible. Many still had surface dirt adhering but appeared to be similarly worn below this. The coins appear to be mostly of the large-sized first to early third century copper alloy denomination known as the sestertius or the smaller fractions of this known as the as and the dupondius. For many of the coins, it was difficult to be certain of the denomination as they have lost edge and surface detail, with only a corroded core remaining. The thickness of some coins suggests that they were originally sestertii. Some later coins including larger fourth century AD nummi have already been excluded from the group as stray finds. The identifiable coins are predominantly second century AD sestertii from the Antonine period with the latest coin tentatively dated to the reign of Commodus (AD 180-192). However, most of the coins could not be closely identified due to their condition and it is possible that this hoard was deposited between this date and the early third century.The coins have been fully catalogued but can be summarised by reign as:Sestertii and fractions:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSestertius\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDupondius / as\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAntoninus Pius (AD 138-161)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 (dp.)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarcus Aurelius (AD 161-180)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCommodus (AD 180-192)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&ndash;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain Antonine Emperor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain Antonine Empress\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain Emperor\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t37\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotals\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t52",

      "Description: A disturbed hoard of 4 late roman silver coins; four siliquae, dating between AD 359 to 402; probably deposited between AD 395 and AD 430.

All the coins are clipped to varying extents, a phenomenon not commonly observed in the silver coins of Roman Britain except at the very end of the occupation (Moorhead and Walton, 2014, 101-102). Although there is some disagreement about the exact year this practice becomes common it appears to commence in the first decade of the 5th Century until c. AD430 when Roman Coinage ceases to be in common circulation. This suggests the coins were probably deposited between AD395 and AD430.Conclusion: It is therefore clear that this hoard contains more than 2 silver coins over 300 years old from the same find and thus constitutes potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",

It is possible that some of the denarii from a scattered group of Roman coins reported previously as LIN-D512B7 (2019 T765) may be associated with this find, but that group considered as a whole was not suggestive of a hoard and was dispersed over a wider area.ConclusionIn conclusion, these coins constitute a prima facie case of Treasure under the Treasure Act 1996 by consisting of more than 10% precious metal content in that they are silver and is of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of the same find.",

      "The hoard was received in as a solid mass of coins corroded together with associated pottery, loose coins and small clusters of coins retrieved from the ploughsoil by the finder. This corroded mass had preserved the shape of its container. The pottery was friable due to conditions of preservation. The mass was 3D scanned by a third party and X-rayed at the British Museum prior to the coins being removed from the hoard, though the density of metal was too high for a good X-ray image. The decision was taken to remove the coins from the lump to aid the valuation process and because there were doubts as to its long term stability in its concreted state.The coins were removed from the lump in the Conservation department of the British Museum and cleaned in order to be identified. This was done in two main sections, with the lower and upper part of the pot, but on preliminary identification there appeared to be no significant difference between the layers in the date or type of coins, suggesting a homogenous deposit.The 268 coins recovered from the hoard are a mixture of silver denarii (the standard silver denomination from the Roman Republic to the early third century AD) and the silver coins of the later third century denomination known today as the &lsquo;radiate&rsquo;. The latter was initially introduced as a double denarius but became debased over the third century. The examples in this hoard are still of good silver content.&nbsp; This admixture of denominations is to be expected in a coin hoard of this date. The earliest coin in the hoard (a very worn denarius of Mark Antony) was over 250 years old at the time of deposition. These coins are known to have circulated for a very long time (two were found in Bag 6 of the Beau Street hoard, dated to the AD 250s (Anthony et al. eds. 2019)). The majority date from the late second to mid- third century AD, ending with the reign of Trebonianus Gallus and his son Volusian (AD 251-3). Hoards of this broad period (Reece period 12, c. AD 238-260) are less common than later third century hoards and more likely to terminate earlier, with the larger issues from the reigns of Philip and Gordian III, or later with coins of Valerian and Gallienus. They have a fairly wide distribution around Britain.",

      "A Roman silver scattered hoard consisting of twenty two siliquae (two of which are fragmentary) and 1 siliqua in 5 fragments, dating to the late 4th ? early 5th century AD (latest coins dated to c. AD 395?402). The group includes at least two contemporary copies, identifiable by their style. Many of them have been clipped to remove silver from the edges of the coins, making them difficult to identify and suggesting a deposition date into the 5th century AD. A catalogue is on file at the BM.Age and metal content: The coins are all over 300 years old and well in excess of 10% silver.Of the same find?The group is closely dated, with issue dates from c. AD 374 to 402. Its composition reflects that of siliqua hoards previously recorded. Such hoards are relatively common finds from Britain, whereas siliquae are rare as single findsConclusion: On the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of Treasure by being silver coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and of one find of more than two coinsSummary of coins by mint and date:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIssue date\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrier\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMilan\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAquileia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIrregular\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t367?75\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t375?8/9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t378/9?388\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t388?95\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t395?402\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUndated\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t23",

      "A group of&nbsp;66 silver late Roman siliquae (including unjoined fragments) and one base metal Roman radiate. Associated artefacts are 1 copper alloy toggle, 1 copper alloy brooch and 1 copper alloy ring fragment. 72 coins and fragments were originally reported but several were found to join when the hoard was studied, giving a total of 66 coins and fragments.The siliqua was the main silver denomination of the late Roman period. These were among the last silver coins minted in the western Roman cities of the Roman Empire in the late fourth and early fifth century but continued to circulate after the collapse of Roman rule over Britain in AD 410. The coins listed span the period&nbsp;AD&nbsp;355-402, ending, as is common with hoards of this date, with siliquae of Arcadius and Honorius dated to AD 395&ndash;402. The coins have been only lightly clipped to remove silver from the edges of the coins, unlike many hoards with a deposition date into the fifth century AD. Some coins have suffered damage from ploughing, with relatively fresh breaks suggesting recent striking of the hoard. A number of these fragments join but12 of the coins counted below remain fragmentary or incomplete, suggesting that more fragments remain in the ground. The total weight in silver of the late Roman coins submitted is 92.5g.The earlier radiate is worn and base and is unlikely to have been part of this hoard, although earlier coins did sometimes remain in the circulation pool.

The object is semi-circular in plan and circular in section with tapering terminals which terminate in old abraded breaks. The surface is heavily abraded and corroded. The metal is light brown in colour. Length: 18.46mm, Width: 7.33mm, Thickness: 2.79mm, Weight: 0.6g74. A complete copper alloy toggle of Iron Age to Early-Roman date (200&nbsp;BC&nbsp;-&nbsp;AD&nbsp;100). The object is a bar-shaped toggle. The toggle has a swollen central section, oval in plan and section with flat top and bottom sides and a central circular hole passing through the centre from top to bottom. To either side of the central section are circular sectioned projections ending in flattened knops. The projections are waisted (narrowed) with each end having a narrowed circular terminal. There are incised circumferential grooves flanking the ventral hole and on the inner side of the projections.&nbsp;The metal is brown with areas of light brown corrosion.Length: 37.65mm, Width: 13.88mm, Thickness: 9.48mm, &nbsp;Diameter (lobe): 12.13mm, Diameter (perforation): 7.90mm, Weight: 16.9g75. An incomplete copper-alloy Colchester derivative, Harlow, double lug brooch of Roman date (AD&nbsp;43-100). The object is a sprung form. The object is composed of hollow circular wings, to the back of which is an integral double perforated attachment loop with two sections of circular sectioned wire retained. The head of the brooch has a rectangular central projection which descends a short way down the head. From the wings the bow projects in a D shape. The bow terminates below the head in a transverse abraded break.The metal is mid-green in colour with a predominantly smooth patina.Mackreth 2011, CD Ha 3.a2.

Ghey): The coins were reportedly found close together and thought to constitute a find of two or more precious coins. However, the national grid references provided were at 6 figures only and when plotted they were some distance apart. It was not possible to demonstrate that these coins were found in the same field.

      "16 Roman silver denarii found in the plough soil over an area 20x30m.Description: The coins of the hoard comprise 16 silver Roman coins of a denomination known as denarii. The date range (see below) spans a period of circa 111 BC &ndash; AD 97 from the earliest republican denarius attributable to the moneyers Appius Claudius Pulcher, T. Manlius Mancinus and Q. Urbinius and dating to 111 BC, to the latest, a denarius of Nerva, dating to AD 97. The heavier degree of wear on the earlier republican coins demonstrates a longer period of circulation compared to the lighter wear and higher grade of the later Imperial coins and suggests contemporary circulation as a group. From their close spatial and chronological association it is likely that these coins were deposited together at some point around the end of the first century AD by either deliberate burial or as a result of a single purse or bag loss. The coins are fully catalogued (see report by S. Maslin on file at BM) but can be summarised by reign or period as:Denarii:Republican &amp; TriumvirateLater republican, named to moneyer (111 &ndash; 46 BC)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4Mark Anthony (32-31 BC)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1ImperialClaudius (AD 51)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1Nero (AD 64-65)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1Vespasian (AD 72-75)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3Titus (AD 79-81)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2Domitian (AD 81-93)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2Nerva (AD 96-97)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2",

(Numbered as image, from wider group of finds)DiscussionRoman denarii of the second century A.D. were coins of fairly fine silver, well above 50% Ag. The four that can be positively identified cover a relatively short period and are of types that circulated and were hoarded together. In the absence of the customary scatter of base-metal coins of the 2nd - 4th centuries usually to be found on Romano-British settlement sites, the six silver coins are best explained as a small associated group, subsequently scattered by agricultural activities, rather than casual losses.",

The coins appear to form an associated group, deposited around the end of the first century AD. At this time, Republican issues still accounted for a significant proportion of the circulating medium (in a recent parallel but slightly earlier deposit (Esclusham, Wrexham, 80s AD; Treasure Wales 16.13) Republican coins accounted for 45 out of a total of 82 coins), before they were withdrawn under Trajan early in the second century. The composition on the group and the relative states of wear on the coins are consistent with their having formed an associated group.",

There are no associated objects.Metal contentThe coins, in principle silver issues, span a period of debasement during which the silver content dropped from around fifty per cent Ag to issues which to all intents and purposes are of copper alloys (typical silver contents are indicated on the list of coins).DiscussionThe coins were found within a limited area and therefore it is more likely than not that they were originally associated in the ground. The latest issues are irregular issues from the time of Carausius (usurper in Britain, 286/7-93) adding the hoard to the many recorded from Wales that were buried during this reign. Late third-century hoards typically include only the highly-debased issues from around 260 onwards. This new find is therefore unusual in having a significant content of the earlier coins and thereby a value as bullion; the continued availability of 'silver' coins in the late third century may relate to the relatively remote location in Roman Britain.",

      "One hundred and eighteen Roman copper-alloy coins, principally from the first half of the 4th century A.D. (see appended list). These may be summarised as follows:Late third century, 2; House of Constantine I; pre-330, 7; 330-35, 79; 335-40, 19; 340-8, 4; 348-50, 2; uncertain, 5.The coins are all of copper alloys containing less than ten per cent of silver by weight.A series of finds from the same general area, comprising pottery and metalwork, was submitted for examination as potentially originally associated with the coins: see reports by Peter Webster and Evan Chapman, attached. None of these finds can be said with any certainty to have been associated with the coins.The coins found by the metal detetorists come from a locality that in 1957 was the site of the discovery of a hoard of Roman coins of similar general types. The original hoard was discovered in situ in the remains of a grey ware pot, following chance observation of coins in plough soil (Boon 1960); traces of a Roman building were found nearby (Thomas 1958, 294). As a hoard of base-metal coins, it was not subject to treasure trove proceedings; the coins and pot were donated to the National Museum of Wales by the then landowners. An unknown proportion of the hoard was not recovered at that time and further coins were recovered through metal detecting in the 1980s (therefore before the introduction of the Treasure Act 1996); twenty-one coins in the landowners' possession have been recorded recently, ten of them found in 1989. Although such coins are commonly found on Roman settlement sites, their numbers suggest strongly an original association, most likely as part of the hoard found in 1957. The new finds are of the same types as previously recorded, though the balance between different periods is biased towards later coins and there are two that date the deposit some years later than previously thought; this may indicate a degree of stratification in the original deposit. There is some ambiguity over the precise findspot of the 1957 hoard, but the new finds come from the precise area recorded on the local Historic Environment Record maintained by the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust. Likewise, the ceramic evidence might perhaps suggest a second deposit, but in my opinion a single original hoard is more likely. Either way, the new finds appear to represent a group of coins originally associated in the ground.",

      "Extract from full report and catalogue by E. Ghey:Description of findThe coins are all of the main silver denomination of the late Roman period, the siliqua. Siliquae were among the last silver coins minted in the western Roman cities of the Roman Empire in the late fourth and early fifth century but continued to circulate after collapse of Roman rule over Britain in AD 410. Many of them have been heavily clipped to remove silver from the edges of the coins, making them difficult to identify and suggesting a deposition date into the fifth century AD.Summary by mint and date:Issue date\t\t\tTrier\t\t\tLyon\t\t\tArles\t\t\tMilan\t\t\tAquileia\t\t\tUncertai\t\t\tTotal\t\t355-64\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t1\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t1\t\t375-8/9\t\t\t1\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t1\t\t\t0\t\t\t2\t\t378/9-88\t\t\t5\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t1\t\t\t6\t\t388-95\t\t\t2\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t2\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t4\t\t395-402\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t7\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t7\t\tTotal\t\t\t8\t\t\t0\t\t\t1\t\t\t9\t\t\t1\t\t\t1\t\t\t20",

      "Found by Archaeology South-East during excavations in 2014 at the site of Land north of A272, east of Billingshurst. The hoard was recovered from a single context, the upper fill of an enclosure ditch.Date: Roman 3rd century ADDescription: A hoard of a minimum of 22 copper alloy coins of the denomination known as a radiate, containing issues of Gallienus, Claudius II and Postumus dating between AD 260 and 270.The latest dateable coin was minted after the death of Claudius II in AD 270 but the presence of at least one contemporary copy of this type might give a deposition date slightly later than this. However there were no coins that could be positively identified as the more common Gallic Empire issues of Victorinus and the Tetrici post-dating AD 269 or as later 'barbarous radiates', suggesting that the hoard was not deposited much later than this date.A number of coins were in poor condition and could not be identified - the presence of fragmentary coins may suggest that the hoard contained more than 22 coins. The hoard is catalogued below (with numbers in right hand column relating to coin numbers in attached photographs.The issues can be summarised as follows:Central empire:Gallienus, AD 260-68              3Salonina                                  1Claudius II, AD 268-70                        8            Divus Claudius                        1Gallic empire:Postumus, AD 260-9                          1Uncertain emperor                              7Irregular                                               1         Total                                                    22 coins (plus fragments)",

      "DiscussionThis Theodosian nummus hoard is representative of the latest Roman assemblages of small change found on the island. Issues of the Theodosian period dominate by some 85% compared to the earlier coin types that happened to still be available in circulation.[1] Such hoards end with coins struck during the joint reign of Arcadius and Honorius, AD 395-402. RIC X dates these up to 403, the year the new college of Arcadius, Honorius and Theodosius II appear together on successor types not present here. The successor nummus type, the first of the triple reign, was the VRBS ROMA FELIX which replaced the VICTORIA AVGGG and SALVS REI PVBLICAE AE4-sized nummi of the old joint imperial college. The VRBS nummi were struck only at Rome since bronze minting had ceased north of the Alps by this point - making their chances of finding their way to Britain very slim indeed. None of the British Theodosian nummus hoards listed by RIC X or on the IARCH database contain the VRBS ROMA FELIX type, and the author of RIC X notes elsewhere that he knew of only one isolated British find near Guildford.[2]In Shiptonthorpe II, the identifiable joint reign types (i.e. with RIC X nos.) form only a small proportion - just over 5% - of the Theodosian material after the death of Magnus Maximus (i.e. AD 388-402). Interestingly, for this period the standard VICTORIA AVGGG and SALVS REI PVBLICAE types of Shiptonthorpe II are joined by a singleton of a contemporary eastern type of Flaccilla, wife of Theodosius. Overall, the impression confirmed here is that supply of nummi to Britain dried up shortly after the death of Theodosius I and the cessation of nummus production in Gaul in the second half of the AD 390s. The largest known Theodosian bronze hoard found in Britain, Caerwent I, thought to have originally contained some seven to eight thousand pieces (RBCH 1611 lists 3950 extant). However, the largest extant late nummus hoard is the more recent discovery at Bishops Cannings, Wiltshire (CHRB X, pp. 426-62): a mixed gold, silver and bronze hoard of some 7407 coins.Remains of textile bagHoard contained remains of textile, mostly wiggled threads where possibly one direction, either warp or weft, had rotted away completely. Analysis at British Museum (Caroline Cartwright) suggests remaining threads linen and, though mineralised on the outside, they retain an inner organic core. Find recovered very wet and air dried slowly. Coins initially soft and friable but toughened up on drying. Many have a fine patina, although the corrosion had unusual features. There were dense patches of very white silicates that had deposited on the bright metal before any corrosion had formed.A few unidentifiable coins and coin fragments were inaccessible for identification within the main consolidated textile mass. Although outside the scope and resources of this report, it would be an interesting future project to see if the fibres could be scientifically examined to put to test Harold Mattingly and J.W.E. Pearce&#39;s &#39;gut feeling&#39; made over seventy years ago of the similar Bermondsey Hoard:[3] &quot;Mr Pearce would prefer a more conservative date [of deposition] - c. AD 430; Mr Mattingly would be more adventurous and consider one of the AD 450 or even later.&quot;[1] Mattingly and Pearce estimated 90% for the 361-coin Bermondsey Hoard (RBCH 1561) although he could more accurately calculate at least 87% of the legible coins were Theodosian issues (NC 1947, pp.167-73). The figure for the more sizeable mixed-denomination Icklingham hoard (RBCH 1590) is 86% of the 972 nummi present and for Caerwent it is 78.5%. Note all Valentinian II entries are apportioned as Theodosian when this is not clear in older coin lists.[2] J. P. C.

RRC 337/3.Measurements: 18.24mm in diameter, 1.66mm thick and 3.4g in weight.Total weight 6.6gDiscussion: This find of two Roman silver coins of the same (close) date from the same field with all probability relates to the same loss or depositional event. They are an isolated find in an area that has, to our knowledge, produced no other Roman coins or objects within 1km. Whether this is a dispersed hoard, votive deposit or purse loss it is not possible to be sure.Conclusion: It is therefore clear that these two coins date to before 1718 and as the coins are precious metal and found in close association they constitute potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",

The bulk of the latter (51 coins) were Roman Republican, as with this portion. The two coins issued by Mark Antony (32-31 BC) are of a type that circulated widely as late as the second century AD due to its lower silver content.The seven additional copper alloy coins (coins A-G) potentially post-date the deposition of this hoard by at least 25-30 years. Further, other non-treasure finds have been recovered from the same immediate vicinity including an Iron Age 'terret' harness ring (100BC - AD 150)[5], a quantity of Roman brooches (AD 80-150)[6] and local domestic Roman Severn Valley Ware pottery (AD 50-350) [7]. These additional finds indicate that the site was inhabited for a considerable period during the later Iron Age and Roman period.The copper alloy coins do form a distinct group that may have been deposited together in the second century AD. Although they are slightly later in date than the silver coinage, they represent a period when silver coinage was in short supply in Britain and locally produced copies made up for a shortage of small change. Whilst they do not constitute Treasure in their own right, being fewer than 10 coins, they are clearly either a small hoard or part of this hoard. There are other precedents for groupings of earlier silver and bronze coins (the Selby Common hoard of 8 denarii to AD 37 and 6 dupondii/asses to Nero, IARCH-6487B0). Combination of earlier silver and Neronian bronze coinage have also been found from archaeological excavation contexts at West Smithfield cemetery IARCH-C626EB and Bloomberg Place in London IARCH-88C596. A recently excavated ritual deposit at Frensham, Surrey, produced a sequence of coinage beginning with earlier silver denarii and terminating with second century bronze coinage. However, given the presence of settlement evidence at this site, it is more likely that the bronze coinage represent a group of single finds not associated with the silver hoard.Metal Content and Age:The silver coins here satisfy the terms of the Treasure Act with regard to age, quantity and metal content. They are certainly more than 300 years old and consist of more than two coins of precious metal content far in excess of the 10% threshold.Recommendation: Given their age and metal content, and the likelihood of being deposited as part of the same find, the silver coins listed above should be regarded as addenda to the previously declared Treasure (2005 T440) and should, therefore, be considered as a prima facie case of Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).Peter ReavillFinds Liaison Officer Portable Antiquities SchemeCatalogue Compiled:Emily FreemanPortable Antiquities Scheme Headley Trust InternHenry NeadPortable Antiquities Scheme - VolunteerAmended byEleanor Ghey, The British Museum 22/5/18 and 21/6/19Peter Reavill, Finds Liaison Officer Portable Antiquities Scheme 17/6/19[5] https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/893741[6] https://finds.org.uk/database/search/results/lat/52.632446/lon/-2.310237/d/1/broadperiod/ROMAN/objectType/BROOCH[7] https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/268761",

      "Summary:Denarii:Republic 30Mark Antony 5Augustus (31 BC - AD 14) 5Tiberius (AD 14?37) 1Plated ancient forgery 1Claudius (AD 41?54) 1Iron Age coins:Gallo-Belgic D quarter stater (c. 80?60 BC) 1Uninscribed British quarter stater (c. 50?20 BC) 1Stater of Cunobelin (c. AD 10?40) 1Dupondius or as: Marcus Aurelius Caesar (AD 139?161) 1Total 47The coins in the hoard are a mixture of Roman and British Iron Age coins. The majority, 35 coins, are Roman Republican silver denarii. There are 8 Roman Imperial denarii from Augustus to Claudius. The three Iron Age coins consist of two uninscribed gold quarter staters and a gold stater of Cunobelin (c. AD 10-40). The earliest coin in the hoard was a Republican Roman denarius issued in 129 BC and the latest was issued during the reign of the emperor Claudius in AD 50?54. The copper alloy dupondius or as dates to the mid second century AD and is likely to be a later stray find. Apart from this coin, the group is consistent with coinage in circulation in the immediate post-conquest period, suggesting deposition in the mid first century AD (although denarii of Mark Antony circulated for a long period and could potentially indicate a later deposition date).The Iron Age coins are of varied date but are all of types that might plausibly be found in the North Thames area in the first century AD. The uninscribed 'Pegasus' quarter stater is recorded as unique in ABC (CCI 97.2163) and placed under Kent. Sills (2017, 40 no. 72) follows this attribution and cites another unillustrated specimen, CCI 10.2782. The Kentish attribution may derive from similarity to uniface uninscribed quarter staters attributed to Dubnovellaunos (ABC 306-12) However this type is stylistically close to other Eastern British Iron Age uninscribed quarter staters, eg ABC 2362-71, Whaddon Chase staters and quarter staters and those attributed to Addedomaros , cf ABC 2526, 2529. The findspots of this specimen and the CCI examples would support such an attribution.Found with the denarii were four objects of Roman date that can be considered to be associated with the coins (identified by Philippa Walton):a) an incomplete and heavily corroded copper-alloy Colchester brooch dating to the mid first century AD. The fragment comprises the head and most of the bow. The brooch measures 34mm in length, with the head having a width of 14mm and the bow a width of 4mm.b) the foot and catchplate of a copper-alloy bow brooch dating to the first or second century AD. The foot is rectangular in plan and triangular in section with the catchplate being triangular in plan.c) an incomplete copper-alloy finger ring dating to the Roman period. The fragment comprises the shoulders and bezel of the ring. The bezel possesses an oval setting filled with degraded blue enamel. The bezel measures 14mm in width, 11mm in length and 4mm in thickness.d) a copper-alloy cruciform stud dating to the Roman period. Each arm is triangular in section and terminates in semi-circular knop which is hemispherical in section. Each knop is decorated with a groove. From the underside of the stud, there extends a central circular lug with a rounded terminal. The stud measures 26mm in width, 6mm in thickness and weighs 9.84g.",

      "Circumstances of FindThe coins were found on 12/11/2017 by metal detecting on cultivated land. The coins were found close together. No pottery or other material relating to a container was discovered. A scatter of Roman coins are known from the parish but no other Roman material has been reported to the PAS from this field.There is a note on the Somerset HER (ref: 43281) based on an OS record card of 1965 that: 'A gold follis of Valens, in mint condition, was found when ploughing. The coin has been incorporated into a brooch and is now in the possession of the finder's wife.' This coin would be from the same field as the current find. Efforts are ongoing to borrow this item for recording but I understand (pers com) that it is indeed a gold coin and therefore a solidus rather than a follis.Description of FindThe hoard consists of one fragmentary miliarensis and one bent gold solidus. Both are extremely rare coins in the area and indeed nationally and area usually found in hoards rather than as separate finds. No other miliarensis or Roman gold coins have been reported in Somerset through the PAS.There are good grounds to consider that these coins were originally deposited as a group and as such qualify as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996. The historic find of a gold solidus, thought to be of Valens, mentioned in HER record 43281 from the same field is also judged to be originally part of this hoard, although as a historic find of a single coin, which was not Treasure on its own at the date of finding, it is not retrospectively considered Treasure under the act.Laura BurnettFinds Liaison Officer for Somerset and DevonSummary \t\t\tValentinian I\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tValens\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\tCatalogueArlesGold\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReign\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMint mark\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt (g)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC ref.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tValens\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t364-367\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDN VALEN-S PF AVG\t\t\tPearl diademed draped and cuirassed bust facing right\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[RE]STITVTOR - REIPVBLICAE\t\t\tEmperor standing facing, head right, holding labarum and Victory on globe.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-//KONSTAN\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.39\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXI Arles 1k var\t\t\t\t\tThessalonicaSilver\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReign\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMint mark\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt (g)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC ref.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tValentinian I\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t364-367\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDN VALENTINI- [ANVS PF AVG]\t\t\tPearl diademed draped and cuirassed bust facing right\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[VIRTVS] - EXCERCITVS\t\t\tEmperior, helmeted, standing facing, head right, holding in right hand reversed spear and resting left on shield\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-//TES\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.53[1]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVol IX, Thessalonica 10a\t\t\t\t\t[1] Broken: old break with about a third of the coin missing",

One coin can be tentatively identified as a coin of Hadrian (AD 117-138) and another is likely to be of Antonine date, that is circa AD 138-192)\t\t\tNumber\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDiameter (mm)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWeight (g)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIssuer / denomination\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFinder\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t30.2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t15.79\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible sestertius\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t27.7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.64\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible worn sestertius (?)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t29.9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14.16\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible sestertius\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t28.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13.27\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible sestertius\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t29.5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13.76\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible sestertius - stg. figure on reverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t27.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12.66\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible sestertius\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t26.4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10.02\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible sestertius (?) - std. figure on reverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t25.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.38\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible worn sestertius or dp./as (?) - obv. head of Hadrian, right.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t24.8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible dp./as - obv. bust of uncertain Antonine empress, r.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t22.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5.96\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible dp./as\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDJ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t23.0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5.71\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible dp./as\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDJ",

      "Two Roman Republican silver denarii dating to the 1st century BC.Description:Coin 1 - Found by Mr. Raymond Piper: A heavily worn silver Roman Republican denarius, possibly issued by C. Vibius Pansa, c. 90 BC. Obverse Laureate head of Apollo right. Legend possibly '[PANSA]', now illegible. Reverse type Minerva in fast quadriga right, crowned by Victory, holding spear and reins in left hand and trophy in right. Legend possibly '[C VIBIVS C F]' in exergue. Probably RRC 342/5 (Crawford 1975). The coin is too worn to be conclusively identified.Measurements: Uncertain, none listed in previous report or record and no scale in image.Coin 2 - Found by Mr Steven Long: A worn silver Roman Republican denarius issued by P. Clodius M. f. at Rome during 42 BC. Obverse: 'Laureate head of Apollo right, lyre behind.', No legend. Reverse type Diana Lucifera standing right, lit long torch in each hand, bow and quiver across shoulder. Legend reads top to bottom 'P CLODIVS' right, 'M.F.' left. RRC 494/23 (Crawford 1975).Measurements: 18mm in diameter and weight of 3.4gDiscussion: This find of two Roman republican silver coins with no early Roman activity in the area suggests that these coins relate to the same loss or depositional event. Whether this is a dispersed hoard, votive deposit or purse loss it is not possible to be sure. It should be noted however that the coins were found in an area of high late Iron Age activity which included a large dispersed potin hoard or hoards which the coins were brought in with, see KENT-B3CDF1 (2011T585) KENT-A07E23 (2017T132) and KENT-588B4F (2017T606). The Republican coins are however significantly later than the Potin hoard, show significant wear and are of types known to be circulating into the 1st century AD.Conclusion:It is therefore likely that these coins belong to the same find and thus, as they are both silver coins, older than 300 years old and found in close association they constitute potential Treasure under the stipulations of The Treasure Act 1996.",

      "The twenty-one radiates form a group, the composition of which is consistent with its having formed an original single deposit in the years after A.D. 270, a period which has produced numerous hoards of such coins in Roman Britain. The rare survival of traces of a woollen textile support the idea that the coins were contained within a bag or wrapped in cloth. The two other coins, from the 1st - 2nd centuries (probably) and the second quarter of the fourth are unlikely to belong to the group; they are perhaps best interpreted as stray finds relating to Roman activity on the site over an extended period.",

      "Circumstances of discovery: Seventeen silver coins were found in plough-soil whilst searching with a metal-detector on 8 May 2017.Date:Roman, late 4th to early 5th century ADDescription: 17 silver siliquae dating from c. AD 360 - 402, clipped and mostly fragmentaryDiscussion: These coins were found at the same 6-figure grid reference as a previously recorded Roman coin hoard (PAS ref: IARCH-B59F4A), the Lindsell hoard of 25 clipped siliquae to AD 402 (Orna-Ornstein 2009) found in 1998-9 and now in Saffron Walden Museum. The coins from this hoard are similar in age and type to those previously recorded and can be seen as belonging to this find.Another finder has declared 3silver siliquae from the same parish from land belonging to the same owner (PAS ref: ESS-6A2235, 2017 T259), but these are sufficiently far apart to be treated as a separate find.Conclusion: In terms of age and quantity, as the 17 coins are over 300 years old and contain a minimum of 10% precious metal, and as addenda to a previously recorded Treasure case, this case qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",

    notes:
      "Around the hoard, within c.20m, was a large quantity of smaller coins in poorer conditions ranging from a sestertius of the 2nd century to nummi of the 370s. These appear to represent a background of stray losses. Hoards of this period often contain radiates and it is possible some of the radiates found nearby may have been deposited with the nummi. In particular two found stuck together by the finder (recorded on the PAS database as SOM-DCA312 and SOM-DCE294) were initially thought to be associated, however their condition is much more similar to the background scatter than the other coins in the hoard so it is my opinion they are probably not associated. One fragment of heavily abraded Roman pottery was also found in the area but again this is probably not associated (SOM-DDD545).",

Die axis: 7.Discussion: Due to the fragmentary condition of the coins it has not been possible to attribute a significant proportion to either an emperor or mint. It is highly likely that a number of fragments within the current assemblage are parts of the same coins, however, only four were found to refit. This also meant that if was difficult to assess the degree of clipping (if any) on most coins, however, the majority which retained part of an original edge appeared to be intact, or only lightly clipped. Most of the breaks were relatively fresh and it is likely that further investigation of the site will result in the recovery of further coins or fragments.The latest coin deposited was that of Honorius (struck c. AD 395 -402), giving a probable deposition date in the first two decades of the fifth century.A number of coin hoards of similar date and composition have been reported as Treasure and are recorded on the PAS database including: GLO-9D7F36 (2014 T599), LVPL-B38AFC (2014 T539), YORYM-F6AE88 (2014 T45), SOM-111833 (2011 T233) & DUR-F2C867 (2012 T432).Groups of two or more coins of precious metal and over 300 years old at the time of finding qualify as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.",

      'Treasure case 2017 T367: Disclaimed, returned to finder25 radiates and nummi to AD 361Circumstances of FindThe coins were found by a single finder within a c. 40m2 area of a ploughed field, no remains of a potential hoard container were recovered and nor were any other objects found in the same area.Description of FindThe group consists of 25 copper alloy roman coins, dating to between AD 269 and AD 361, with a clear focus on the latter end of this range and on the years AD 350-353 in particular. Of the 25 coins, 19 belong to Reece Period 18 (AD 348-361) and 10 of these were issued by either Magnentius or Decentius (AD 350-353). The coins are in uniformly poor condition, with a hard, brown concretion affixed to the surface of many, leaving them wholly or partially illegible. Illustrative of this point is that the mint could only be ascertained on 4 of the 25 coins, however it is likely that further detail survives under this outer layer. Despite these limitations, and the lack of other site finds further complicating interpretation, the group contains a clear "core" hoard of the larger, heavier issues which followed the reform of AD 348, numbering 14 coins in total, with the other coins probably representing a mixture between genuine inclusions in the hoard and a more general site scatter. The latest coin which is almost certainly associated with the hoard is No. 11, a FEL TEMP REPARATIO issue of Constantius II depicting a soldier spearing a fallen horseman and dating to AD 353-361. Other coins of this issue are also included in the group; however, their light weight would suggest that they are contemporary copies. The lack of any identifiable coins of Julian may suggest a deposition date in the earlier period of this range.Coin hoards of the mid-4th century frequently contain fairly wide date ranges, see for example 2013 T885, from Dorset, which ranged from AD 260-375 (Hayward Trevarthen 2013) and 2015 T853, Somerset, ranging from AD 276-355 (Shoemark 2015), and it is not impossible that all of the coins in the group are associated with the hoard. However, the relatively high proportion of contemporary copies as well as the presence of coins of Reece Period 17, which are frequently poorly represented or entirely absent in Period 18 hoards (see for example the discussions in Shoemark 2015, or Abdy in Tyrell 2013) would suggest that, some at least, are near contemporary individual losses.There is good reason to assume that the majority (at least 14 coins) of this group forms a dispersed hoard deposited in the second half of the 4th century. Although the group likely also contains individual losses, given that at present the hoard must be interpreted in isolation of other site finds no coins in particular can be singled out as being certainly not part of the hoard and it is therefore the opinion of the present author that the coins be treated as a group. The hoard therefore comprises of 10 or more base metal coins which are more than 300 years old, and thus qualifies for consideration as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.Wil PartridgeFinds Liaison Officer for Devon and SomersetJuly 2017Bibliography:Hayward Trevarthen, C (2013) DOR-5C9A85: A ROMAN COIN HOARD Web page available at: https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/591014 [Accessed: 3 Jul 2017 12:16:05] Catalogue by Richard Abdy.Shoemark, J and Wilding, D.

The ingot has been hammered flat, with straight, vertical sides and rounded ends. The edges are sharp and the surface is otherwise unmarked. At 49.90g the ingot is a little under 2 Roman ounces and within the acceptable range for this period (R. Hobbs, pers.comm.).Discussion:The 13 silver coins (siliquae) in this group span the reigns of the emperors Valentinian I to Arcadius, with the single gold coin (solidus) issued by Honorius in AD 395?402. The coins span the time period 364?402. That being said, the majority of the silver coins in this hoard (coins 3,4,6?11 and 14) are clipped. This phenomenon is not commonly observed in silver coins in Britain except at the very end of the Roman period in Britain (Moorhead and Walton 2014, 101?102). Although there is some disagreement amongst authors about the exact year this practice becomes common it appears to have originated some point in the first decade of the 5th century remaining common until Roman coinage ceased to be in common circulation c. AD 430.The presence of ingots is recorded in early 5th century coin hoards from Coleraine, Traprain Law and Canterbury (Moorhead and Walton 2014, 102). However they are relatively uncommon finds and are not generally found with small siliqua hoards in the absence of other hacksilver. This ingot is of unusual form; it is not an official stamped 'ox-hide' shaped ingot (as found at Coleraine, Canterbury and the Tower of London) but it is much less worn than the finger ingots associated with the Coleraine hoard and found at Vindolanda. It is therefore tempting to see it as related to the practice of clipping siliquae but this is pending scientific examination of its metal content. It can perhaps be compared to a surviving ingot from the Whorlton hoard from North Yorkshire, which also had a tpq of AD 395?402 (the ingot is illustrated from a photograph only in Johns 1979 plate 5, no. 6).",

      "Treasure case 2017 T332: Disclaimed, returned to finder.2 Roman denarii to AD 194, part of a larger hoard of 3 denarii to AD 211Circumstances of FindFound while metal detecting on grassland by a single finder. A third denarius was also found nearby by a separate finder, recorded as SOM-ED5125, and which was probably also associated with this hoard.Description of FindThe hoard consists of 2 Roman Denarii, at one of which is a plated contemporary copy, both dating to the second century. The earlier coin, of Trajan (AD 98-117) is a contemporary copy, with silver surface peeling away in several places revealing a copper alloy core beneath. There is no obvious indication that the second coin is also a contemporary copy, this coin being of Septimius Severus (AD 193-211) minted in the east of the empire during this emperor's second imperatorial acclamation (AD 194). SOM-ED5125, was almost contemporary with this latter coin, being of Julia Domna (AD 193-217), struck in the period AD 196-211. In general, the coins appear unworn, although the Denarius of Julia Domna is more heavily corroded. The wide date range seen here is not atypical for Roman coin hoards of this period (e.g. 2015T210, 137BC - AD 138; 2015T201, AD 81 - 197; 2014T203, AD 69 - 169). The lack of other Roman material in the area as well as the unworn state of the coins would suggest their deposition as part of a hoard.There are good grounds to consider that these coins were originally deposited as a group and thus considered a hoard of two or more precious metal coins (plus one base metal copy), under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996. However, since the first discovery was previously logged as a single find (as SOM-ED5125) it cannot retrospectively come under consideration here.Wil PartridgeFLO for Devon and SomersetJune 2017Summary \t\t\tTrajan, AD 98-117\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptimius Severus, AD 193-211\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Julia Domna\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\tCatalogue\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReign\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt (g)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC ref.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrajan\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t103-111\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[IMP] TRAIANO AVG GER DAC PM TR [P] (Bust right, laur.)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCOS V PP SPQR OPTIMO PRINC, DAC [C]AP (in EX.)

A plastic bag of loose coins was placed in the pot below some soil and further coins, and a small number had been coated in olive oil by the finder, which was later removed in the laboratory.Coins were removed from the pot in 8 layers each subdivided in two halves by the conservator, Saray Naidorf. The contents of each layer were sorted by emperor but no difference was found between the layers to suggest that they had been sorted or deposited at different dates. A small amount of plant material (chaff) and the remains of one insect were found associated with the coins, preserved by proximity to copper.The coinsThe coins in the hoard are all of the denomination commonly referred to as a radiate and date from the joint reign of Valerian and Gallienus (AD 253-260) to the final year of the reign of Probus (AD 276-282). The earliest coins have a higher silver content but the bulk of the hoard is made up of the debased copper alloy coinage issued in large quantities under the Gallic empire (AD 260-274). The hoard has a small number of later coins with higher silver content that post-date the coinage reform under Aurelian.Compared to other hoards of similar size and date, the Harbridge hoard has a relatively high percentage of coins of the sole reign of Gallienus (18.7%). It also has a relatively high proportion of coins of Victorinus to the Tetrici, in which it compares closely to the Aldbourne hoard (Besly 1984). This could suggest that the bulk of the hoard was formed at a relatively early date. However, unlike the Aldbourne hoard, there did not appear to be a significant variation in the proportion of these coins within the layers of the hoard itself.Associated artefactsThe coins were contained in a broken jar, although the fragments were held together with bandages to allow removal of the coins. It was associated with a vessel of 'dog bowl' form, possibly used as a lid, and a bag of associated sherds. It was not possible to comment on the fabric of these vessels due to adhering soil and examination by a local pottery specialist is recommended. The jar appears to be a grey-ware vessel with a beaded rim. The body has a wide band of diamond-shaped lattice decoration. The dog-bowl is of coarser fabric, with a black exterior and white interior. It has a flat rim and a flat base.An iron nail 20.1mm long and with a flat head 10.6mm diameter, 2.74g. The short shaft was circular in section, possibly broken. This was not diagnostic in date.Also associated with the hoard were two flint fossils, possibly belemnites, although these also have not been studied by an expert. These could be naturally occurring in a chalk soil, though it should be noted that fossils are sometimes found in special deposits dating to the Roman period. Such an association would be convincing if they were found within the hoard container but no information on their relationship was provided.Summary: (full catalogue at the British Museum)Central empireValerian and Gallienus, AD 253-260Valerian I 25Gallienus 14Salonina 33Valerian II 1Saloninus 2Diva Mariniana 1Divus Valerian II 1Gallienus, AD 260-68 825 + 1 denariusSalonina, 74Quietus 1Claudius II, AD 268-70 379Divus Claudius II 24Quintillus, AD 270 32Aurelian, AD 270-5 16 (inc. 2 pre-reform)Severina 1Tacitus, AD 275-6 31Florian, AD 276 2Probus, AD 276-282 59Gallic empirePostumus, AD 260-9 174Laelian, AD 269 3Marius, AD 269 26Victorinus, AD 269-71 1330Divus Victorinus 2Tetricus I, AD 271-4 1150Tetricus II 477Uncertain Gallic empire 58 (inc. 4 rev. brockages)Irregular 49Uncertain emperor (inc. frags) 14Total 4805",

      "The coins were all in a poor state of preservation (corroded or fragmentary) and many that retained their surfaces appeared to be worn smooth of most of their detail from many decades of continued circulation. The last legible sestertius was of the reign of Septimius Severus; an early obverse of Julia Domna hybridised with a reverse type proper to the Emperor coinage of AD 195. The addenda yeilded a dupondius or as of Julia Domna from roughly the same period, AD 193-8.If not stray finds, it seems possible that the few radiates represent contemporary coins with the remnants of the old sestertius circulation now kept as raw material alongside a scrapped quarter of a copper alloy disc. (At least two of the sestertii shows evidence of file marks)Associated objects submitted for examination with the coins (report by Eleanor Ghey)1. Copper alloy fragment.A fragment of sheet metal with a curved lower edge and broken top edge (across the width of the fragment). The shorter side edge is straighter with a slight inwards curve in the centre. It meets the lower edge in a rounded corner, the tip of which may be missing. The inner surface is lightly concave and the outer lightly convex. The inner surface undulates slightly with parallel ridges or striations running across the width, possibly made by gouging with a rounded object. The piece has a dark green patina with possible traces of silvering (particularly on the inner surface, which is also covered in patches of black corrosion products). The outer surface is smooth. There is no evidence of any surface decoration.Width 41.9mm, length 42.5mm. depth 26.7mm. Thickness 3.5 mm at curved outer edge and 3.2mm at break. 19.10g2. Copper alloy broochA Roman copper alloy bow-and-fantail brooch, with some elements in common with aesica and trumpet-derivative types, dating to the first to second century AD. A disc in the centre of the bow contains a four-petalled flower bordered by a circular cell filled with red enamel. A circular cell in the centre of the flower may once have contained red enamel. Where the bow meets the head of the brooch there are two empty circular cells and a triangular cell containing traces of red enamel. Above this cell and between the wings is a triangular panel containing incised lines in a herringbone pattern. The tubular wings have moulded decoration and would have held an enclosed pin; only traces of iron corrosion survive. One wing is partially broken.The brooch terminates in a fantail, the corners of which are broken. This is decorated with a crudely incised lozenge containing hatching and a hatched border, with two empty circular cells, one of which is partly missing. In the centre of the reverse of the foot is a catch-plate in the form of a lug projecting downwards with a rounded tip. The brooch has a shiny dark green patina and may be of greater antiquity than the hoard in which it was deposited.No direct parallel was found for this brooch. The form is similar to the bow-and-fantail type, some of which have a central rosette on the bow with enamel decoration (for example Hattatt 2000, 315 fig 174 no. 74), sometimes with a central stud (as in SOM-3FFAE7 with a floral motif on a flattened bow and a tubular head. Other similarly shaped brooches from the South West with such incised decoration recorded on the PAS database are DOR-5611A3 and SOM-45CCB3, the latter with a domed central boss. The latter are listed as Late Iron Age brooches by Mackreth (2011, 32 and Vol. II Plate 18, no. 6172) but are not dated. There is similarity between the incised decoration on the foot of this brooch and that of SOM-45CCB3.Length 35.5, width (head) 28.5, diameter of disc 17.9mm 18.37gReferencesMackreth, D.F. 2011.

      "Treasure case 2016 T948: Disclaimed, returned to finderReport by Eleanor Ghey, British MuseumCircumstances of discoveryThis hoard of Magnentian nummi was found on 8th November 2016 while metal-detecting on pasture. The coins were found together at 12-14 inches depth. Two ceramic body sherds were found nearby but are not definitely associated with the hoard and are very abraded (61.22g and 20.62g). They are of pale grey fabric with large quartz and flint ? inclusions and may be from a mortarium. One further illegible coin of first to third century date was found later 12 feet away and at a depth of three feet and is probably not related to this deposit. A late third century radiate could also be a stray find, although these are sometimes found in fourth century hoards.The coins were manually cleaned in the conservation laboratory of the British Museum to allow identification but traces of organic material (possibly leather) were found on a few coins and retained. Due to the concreted condition of the coins the cleaning process did not render them all fully legible; over half of the coins could not be assigned to a mint. It is also likely that the hoard contains more irregular coins than could be positively identified, in common with other hoards of this date.The coinsThe hoard has a relatively narrow date range from AD 348 to 354. The bulk of the hoard is made up of the larger module FEL TEMP REPARATIO coins from AD 348 to 350 and smaller module Magnentian coins, particularly those of the two Victories VICTORIAE DD AVGGQ NN reverse types. It closes with one coin of SALVS AVG NOSTRI type, dated late in the reign of Magnentius, probably to early AD 353 and a single post-Magnentian FEL TEMP falling horseman coin of Constantius Gallus Caesar dated AD 353-4. The mints that could be identified were all of the Western Empire. Hoards of similar date include the Wheaton Aston, Staffordshire hoard and the Wokingham hoard.R. Bland 1997.

      "Second addendum to the Marham hoard which is otherwise recorded at .NMS-3EF493 (2013 T420 and 2014 T83) and summary at IARCH-677D3D.Description: 5 copper alloy Roman radiates, 3 of Carausius (AD 286-93) and 2 of Allectus (AD 293-6), forming part of a dispersed hoard. Two groups of coins were recovered previously, 14 in 2013 (2013 T420) and a further 8 in 2014 (2014 T836). This latest addition brings the total number of coins up to 27. As noted in the report for the original group, most of the coins are corroded, but appear to have been in good condition when deposited. It was proposed that the hoard was likely deposited c. AD 296, possibly as a result of the re-conquest of Britain by Constantius Chlorus. Given the de-monetisation of these coins shortly afterwards, the hoard cannot have been deposited much later. This latest group of coins sits well within the existing group and does not alter the original interpretation.",

      "This record covers Treasure cases 2016T788 and 2017T1204.A Roman coin hoard, initially consisting of&nbsp;92&nbsp;Roman radiates (2016T788) with one unrelated Roman coin (an as of Vespasian). Later joined by two addenda:&nbsp;2017T1204 (five copper-alloy Roman radiates, one of which is fused to a sixth, incomplete coin; catalogue&nbsp;added to this record, below) and 2020T23 (fourteen Roman coins, recorded separately at&nbsp;NMS-1F78BF).2016T788: A scattered hoard of 92&nbsp;base silver and copper alloy Roman radiates dating to the period c. AD 258-279. The coins were found scattered over an area of c. 15 metres with a few outliers, but appeared to be most densely concentrated towards the line of the hedgerow bordering the field. The coins were in poor condition with a number fused together, and many of them are illegible to some degree. No images were taken other than the latest coin = Probus, mint of Lyon; Bastien&#39;s series 4 or 6 (AD 277 / 279).Unrelated coins from the same find: A heavily worn as of Vespasian&nbsp;(coin type 1) was submitted as being potentially part of the hoard, but it was found well away from the main scatter zone and does not exhibit any signs of having been deposited with the other coins in the group. It is, therefore, likely to be unrelated to the hoard and is tabulated separately below. One milled coin (illegible) was initially handed in as part of the group, but was subsequently discovered to be modern and is not included in the catalogue.Catalogue:&nbsp;The table below lists 53 coin types, from no. 2 to no. 54.

For this reason, it has not been possible, in most cases to assign a mint. Those which are legible, or partially legible, consist of a mixture of legitimate issues and contemporary copies from the Central and Gallic empires, the majority being copper alloy, with a small percentage of base silver, or silver washed coins present; these are mostly from the sole reign of Gallienus (AD 260-268) and the reform under Aurelian and his successors. A single silver radiate of Gallienus&#39; joint reign with Valerian (dated AD 258-259) is the earliest coin represented. The latest ruler represented is (Probus (AD 276-282). A small quantity of barbarous copies are also present.2017T1204:&nbsp;A scattered hoard of six&nbsp;copper alloy Roman radiates. Five are complete, one of which is fused to a sixth, incomplete coin.

For this reason, it has not been possible, in most cases to assign a mint. The current group of coins under discussion fits well in terms of date and rulers represented with the previous group of coins recorded and does not alter the proposed date range.",

      "Also found and imaged on the PAS record (image 18) was a circular bronze object with trefoil design, 11.48g; max. diam. 30mm. X-radiography revealed the design to be openwork with three petal-shaped segments around a central pellet in an open circular frame. The oval &#39;petals&#39; contain circular cells that appear to be filled with enamel (possibly yellow in colour). This can be identified as an example of a type object of uncertain function known as a &#39;dangler&#39; (sometimes &#39;fob dangler&#39;) that dates from the late Iron Age to early Roman period. It is missing a protruding shank on the reverse - some complete examples have suspension loops attached. These artefacts may be a decorative element on horse harness or other personal equipment - earlier examples often have a triskele motif but the oval petals here seem to suggest a first to second century AD date. For similar examples on the PAS database see NCL-970F06 and YORYM-30130C.This pattern fits well with that which might be expected for a hoard of Roman coins of mixed denomination deposited early in the late second century AD. The eight later coins do not fit into the pattern of the hoard and can be considered as stray finds from the same site. The dangler is likely to be of similar date to the coins and could therefore be considered as an associated object, although this association cannot be proven in the absence of archaeological context.Recommendation on the status of TreasureOn the balance of probability, the 22 first to second century coins considered above belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being part of a find of two or more precious metal coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years. The contemporary Roman object found in association with the coins should be likewise considered treasure.",

The coins are all base metal nummi (sing. nummus) dating to between AD 294 and 305. This was the era of a collegiate system of imperial rule (usually 4 official rulers and thus known as Tetrarchy) set up by the great reforming emperor Diocletian (AD 284-305). Aside from Diocletian himself, his two colleagues governing the western half of the empire, Maximian and Constantius Chlorus, are also represented.1. A copper alloy Roman nummus of Maximian I, c.

      'Treasure case 2015 T853: Disclaimed returned to finderCircumstances of FindThe coins were found on 02/11/2015 by two people metal detecting on ploughed land. The coins were found in a concentrated group and were recovered by the detectorists on the same day. The detectorists took a number of photos of the hoard as it was excavated. No pottery was found with the coins, however, there were three copper alloy loops of varying circumference found deposited with the hoard and these can plausibly be suggested as fastenings for a now decomposed leather or textile bag. A hoard of Roman radiates from Seavington (2013 T775) was found with a similar copper alloy ring and traces of organic material adhering to the coins and it was proposed that this also had been the fastening for a leather bag. The concentration of the coins and the way in which a number of the coins have fused together also support the hypothesis that they were deposited in at least one bag. The photos suggest that the hoard was deposited in a single pit or ditch. The finders dug around either side of the zone of concentration and detected around the general area, suggesting that all of the coins have been recovered.Description of FindThe hoard consists largely of coins dating to after the reform of 348, although there are also seven radiates of various emperors and two early large module nummi, one Genio Popvli Romani type of Maxentius and one Soli Invicto Comiti type of Constantine I. In common with the Welbourn hoard, amongst others, coinage of the period AD 318 - 348 is not represented.Summary by date and mint \t\t\t\t\t\tAmiens\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrier\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLyon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAquileia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSiscia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThessalonica\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t260 - 294\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t294 - 307\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t307 - 318\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t348 - 350\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t17\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t350 - 351\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t351 - 353\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t53\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t353 - 361\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t31\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t26\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t83\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t127\t\t\t\t\tOf the Fel Temp Reparatio (FH) series, all appear to be of the later FH types issued after the deaths of Magnentius and Decentius in 353. Of these, only one is definitively a copy, although the die axes on a number of the coins suggest that they may not be legitimate. Provisional examination of these coins suggests that none were issued after c. AD 354 and the execution of Constantius Gallus. One coin from Arles exhibiting the new CON mint mark adopted in late 353 is present. There appear to be no coins of Julian present, reinforcing the case for a provisional deposition date of c. AD 354 - 355.A high proportion of the coins could not be attributed to a mint due to poor preservation or bad striking.Radiates (7)Uncertain ruler (2).\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObv.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRev.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRev.

      "Treasure case 2015 T830: Acquired by Salisbury Museum.Mere IIICircumstances of discovery: Metal detecting on cultivated land. It appears to be unrelated to Mere I (1856), an Antonine denarius hoard consisting of about 270 coins within a courseware pot found on the land of the Duchy of Cornwall (RBCH 278), or Mere II (c.1870), about 100 barbarous radiates (RBCH 816).Description: The group consists of seven silver Roman denarii ranging in date from AD 70-AD 128. The composition of the group appears typical of Roman denarius hoards found in Britain (Cf. SWYOR-9A0FFD, HESH-70C170, IARCH-168938). Furthermore, the coins both exhibit wear and patination consistent with coins from a first or second century denarius hoard.Six of the coins were found individually within approximately two weeks, however, all six were reported to the PAS on the same day. A seventh coin was found in June 2016 and was reported by the finders. According to the finders the coins were found within close proximity of one another, within a c. 10m radius. This is well within the established scatter zone for Roman coin hoards. Cf. SOM-6E89B0, SOM-111833 & SOM-B72B90.Metal Content:Roman silver coinage from the late first century BC to the early second century AD usually exhibited a purity of c. 90 - 98% silver. Under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 coin hoards must consist of at least two coins each comprising a minimum of 10% precious metal.Conclusion:In conclusion, owing to their close date range and the close proximity in which they were found to one another the coins belong together as a hoard. They therefore constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being silver coins consisting of more than 10% precious metal content of an antiquity greater than 300 years.Summary:Vespasian (AD 69-79), 2Trajan (AD 98-117), 3Hadrian (AD 117-38), 2 (types minted between AD 119-28; COS III without PP)CatalogueVESPASIAN (2)Obv (1): [IMP CAESAR] VESPASIANVS AVG\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBust\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt.\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t[COS ITER] TR [POT ](Neptune standing with right foot on prow holding dolphin and trident.).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA1*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 70\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVol II cf. 25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.36\t\t\t\t\tObv (1): CAESAR VESPASIANVS AVG (legend in retrograde)\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBust\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt.\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tIMP XIX (Sow left with three piglets.).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA1*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 77-78\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVol II cf. 982\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.63\t\t\t\t\tTRAJAN (3)Obv (1): IM[P CAE]S NERVA TRAIAN AVG GERM PM\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBust\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt.\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tTR P COS II PP (Pax seated left holding branch and sceptre.).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA1*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 98-99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVol II 29\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.25\t\t\t\t\tObv (1): IMP CAES NERVA TRAIAN AVG GERM\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBust\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt.\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tP M TR P COS IIII PP (Victory advancing left, holding wreath and palm)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA3*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 101-102\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVol II 67\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.91\t\t\t\t\tObv (1): IMP CAES NERVA TRAIAN AVG [G]ERM\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBust\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt.\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tP M TRP COS IIII PP (Hercules standing front on altar, holding club and lion's skin)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA1*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 101-102\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVol II 49\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.75\t\t\t\t\tHADRIAN (2)Obv (1): [IMP CA]ESAR TRAIAN HADRIANVS AVG\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBust\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt.\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tP M TR P COS III (Roma helmeted, seated l. on cuirass, holding Victory and spear.).\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA3*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 119-128\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVol II 78\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.01\t\t\t\t\tObv (1): HADRIAN[VS] AVGVSTVS\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBust\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt.\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\tCOS III (Victory seated l. holding wreath and palm, globe in exergue)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA2*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 125- 128\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVol II\t\t\t184\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.53",

      "2015 T802: a hoard of 17 late Roman copper-alloy nummi of the House of Constantine dating c.307-335. They were found in the plough-zone by eight individuals, in an area measuring circa 6m by 6m. No other items of Roman date were found in the vicinity.Description of the coinsAll the coins are Constantinian nummi (sing. nummus) (i.e. of the emperor Constantine the Great, AD 306-337, and his family) of the period c. AD 307-335. Those nummi are copper alloy coins with a tiny admixture of silver. They were made in various mints from around the Roman Empire as follows: \t\t\t\t\t\tLondon   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrier   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLyon   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArles   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSiscia   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Total  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 307-17     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 317-24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 324-30\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 330-35\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t12\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t17\t\t\t\t\tFrom the same find?The coins cover a chronologically close period of a few decades, much like we would expect to find in our purses today.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being base metal coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces.CATALOGUEPeriod 307-317MEMORIA FELIXLondon1.

      "2015 T765: HARTLEBURY (ADDENDA), WORCESTERSHIRE13 nummi to AD 325 BM ref.: 2015 T765This is a second addendum of 13 copper-alloy Roman coins, known as nummi, dating to between c.AD 307-324 discovered in Hartlebury, Worcestershire. The original find in 2012 (2012 T148) was a hoard of 14 similar Roman copper-alloy coins dating to AD 318-324, with a further addendum of 14 coins in 2014 (2014 T573). Both previous groups of coins were reported as potential Treasure and disclaimed by the crown due to no national or local museum interest. This latest addendum comprises an initial group of 11 nummi and one, probably unrelated, 3rd century AD radiate (see below; Catalogue no. 14). An additional, worn nummus of similar type discovered in September 2014 and recorded in 2015 (Catalogue no. 13) is likely to form part of the same group, as is a further example recovered between the date of the addendum find and this report (Catalogue no. 4).The coins of this addendum were discovered by ten individual finders, all of whom belong to the Midlands Metal Detecting Club.Summary of all coin finds by date and reverse type \t\t\t\t\t\tOriginal find:\t\t\t2012 T148\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAddenda I:\t\t\t2014 T573\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAddenda II:\t\t\t2015 T765\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGENIO POP ROM (AD 307-10)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSOLI INVICTO COMITI (AD 313-18)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVICTORIAE LAETAE PRINC PERP (AD 318-20)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVIRTVS EXERCIT (AD 320-1)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tD N CONSTANTINI MAX AVG (AD 320-5)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCAESARVM NOSTRORVM (AD 321-4)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBEATA TRANQVILLITAS (AD 321-4)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBEAT TRANQLITAS (AD 322-324)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSARMATIA DEVICTA (AD 323-4)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPROVIDENTIAE CAESS (AD 324-5)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain reverse (AD 318-24)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t14\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13\t\t\t\t\tThe composition of this group of 13 coins, combined with the original hoard and previous addenda, is typical of what might be expected for coinage circulating in Britain by the AD 320s. Other coins from the site include a mixture of denominations that have a chronological span much broader than the period the hoard is likely to have been deposited, and include stray finds such as the barbarous radiate reported here (Catalogue no. 14) in conjunction with the later nummi. This is unlikely to form part of the hoard group for the purposes of the Treasure Act 1996 and as such is treated as a stray find.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, given their similar coin types, chronological range, and preservation, this group of 13 coins dating to c.AD 307-325 belong together as a second addendum to the previously reported coin hoard (2012 T148, with addendum 2014 T573) from Hartlebury. Their recovery from the same location as the initial hoard and composition as a group of base metal coins exceeding ten in number with antiquity of more than 300 years suggests they constitute a prima facie case of Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996. The additional single radiate coin mentioned above should be excluded as unrelated to the treasure case.AuthorsPeter ReavillFinds Liaison Officer, Portable Antiquities SchemeDr. Andrew BrownAssistant Finds Advisor and Treasure Curator, British MuseumCatalogue Compiled with the help of Mr. Henry Nead - PASt explorer volunteerMuseum Resource Centre, LudlowMay 2017CATALOGUENote: Bust types follow RIC VII.London (3)P A//PLON (AD 321)Obv.: CONSTANTI-NVS IVN N C (Constantine II)\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBust\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC VII\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\tBEATA TR[AN-QVIL]LITAS (Globe on altar inscribed VOT/IS/XX)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tC3l\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t216\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t- -//PLON?

      "A possible scattered hoard of three silver Roman denarii dating to the period 68 BC - AD 79.A silver Republican denarius of C. Hosidius Geta dating to the year 68 BC (Reece period 1). C. HOSIDI C. F reverse type depicting a boar facing right, wounded by a spear and attacked by a hound. Mint of Rome. Cf. RRC, no. 407/2.A silver denarius of Augustus dating to the period 18 - 17 BC (Reece period 1). VOT P SVSC PRO SAL ET RED I O M SACR reverse type depicting Mars, helmeted and cloaked, standing left, holding a vertical vexilum in his right hand and a parazonium over his left shoulder. Mint of Colonia Patricia. Cf. RIC, Vol. I, p. 51, no. 150a. Both the obverse and reverse legends are in retrograde.A silver denarius of Domitian as Caesar under Vespasian dating to the year AD 79 (Reece period 4). PRINCEPS IVVENTVTIS reverse type depicting Spes standing right, resting on column, feeding a snake out of a patera. Mint of Rome. Cf. RIC Vol. II (Second edition), p. 136, no. 1084. The obverse legend is in retrogade.DiscussionThe group consists of three silver Roman denarii ranging in date from 68 BC - AD 79. The composition of the group appears typical of Roman denarius hoards found in Britain (Cf. SWYOR-9A0FFD, HESH-70C170). Furthermore, the republican and the Augustan coins both exhibit wear and patination consistent with coins from a first or second century denarius hoard. Silver coins of the Roman Republic continued in use as currency until the beginning of the second century AD, when they were withdrawn under the emperor Trajan ( AD 98 - 117). A single cast contemporary copy of a denarius of Septimius Severus (SOM-A0AD17) from the same field was previously reported to the PAS in 2011 and this may represent an associated find, although under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 it cannot retrospectively be declared Treasure.The coins were found individually over the course of approximately one year, however, all three were reported to the PAS as part of a larger assemblage of metal detected finds on the same day. According to the finders the coins were found within close proximity of one another, within a c. 30 - 60m radius. This is well within the established scatter zone for Roman coin hoards. Cf. SOM-6E89B0, SOM-111833 & SOM-B72B90 which constitute the original find, plus two addenda of a hoard of Roman siliquae found scattered over a 40m radius & WILT-5E83F4 which was distributed over a maximum radius of 155m.Metal ContentRoman silver coinage from the late first century BC to the early second century AD usually exhibited a purity of c. 90 - 98% silver. Under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 coin hoards must consist of at least two coins each comprising a minimum of 10% precious metal.ConclusionIn conclusion, on the balance of probabilities, the coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being silver coins consisting of more than 10% precious metal content of an antiquity greater than 300 years.",

Treasure case no. 2015 T591.The coins are copper alloy nummi ranging in date from the very last years of the 3rd century AD to the late AD 320s. The latest coins were struck in AD 327-8. Half of the coins in the hoard are from the London mint, whereas another quarter is from the Trier mint. On the whole, the chronological distribution of the coins is similar to that of hoards terminating in the second half of the AD 320s, before the nummus was reduced in weight in AD 330. The hoard contains a majority of coins dating to the period AD 317-324 (330 nummi) and a significant share of coins struck in the period AD 324-330 (95 nummi). The main peculiarity of the hoard lies in the presence of 24 earlier nummi issued in the period AD 294-317, whereas the reform of the coinage in AD 318 was generally accompanied by the demonetisation of earlier issues.SummaryPeriod 294-307: 9 (London: 2; Trier: 4; Lyon: 1; Ticinum: 1; Carthage: 1)Period 307-313: 5 (London: 2; Trier: 3)Period 313-317: 10 (London: 2; Trier: 5; Lyon: 1; Ticinum: 1; Rome: 1)Period 317-324: 330 (London: 196; Trier: 66; Lyon: 14; Arles: 7; Ticinum: 10; Aquileia: 2; Rome: 5; Siscia: 8; Sirmium: 1; Thessalonica: 8; Heraclea: 2; Uncertain mint: 10; Irregular: 1)Period 324-330: 95 (London: 23; Trier: 36; Lyon: 3; Arles: 10; Rome: 2; Siscia: 2; Thessalonica: 1; Heraclea: 1; Constantinople: 1; Nicomedia: 3; Cyzicus: 4; Uncertain mint: 8; Irregular: 1)",

      "A group of 19 silver coins, eight Roman denarii and eleven Icenian silver units found during Archaeological excavation over a small area. They clearly represent a hoard dispersed at some point in the past. Judging by the relatively high levels of wear on the latest closely datable coin, a denarius of Augustus struck c.19BC (coin 7), this hoard was probably lost or deposited in the mid-first century AD. It is tempting to connect it with either the Roman invasion of AD43 or the Boudiccan revolt of AD60/61. It thus parallels a number of mixed hoards of Roman denarii and Icenian silver units from elsewhere in Norfolk.CatalogueRoman coins1.

      "A hoard of sixteen silver denarii ranging in date from Vespasian (69-79) to Severus Alexander (222-8). These were found in the same field as a larger hoard of over 1,000 coins discovered by the same finders in 2004 (2004T463) with addenda (2006T149, 2008T640, 2010T131, 2015T221, 2016T200; see PAS records NMS-F33213 and NMS-7FB747). The original hoard ended in circa 241 AD, and these latest coins are broadly similar to the contents of that hoard. However, although concentrated in a small area they were found in a very different part of the field to the other coins and appear to represent a second deposit of denarii, very similar to the first. Double hoards deposited close to one another are well attested and it seems that this represents another case of such. This second group contains proportionately more early material than the first hoard, but it also represents as yet a small sample.Details of the coins are as follows..1. Vespasian or Titus, 69-73, RIC ? (caduceus).2. Vespasian, 69-79, RIC ? (figure standing left).3. Vespasian, 69-79, RIC 89ff (eagle, head left).4. ?Vespasian, 69-79, RIC ? (?figure seated left).5. Vespasian, 69-79, RIC ? (illegible reverse).6. Vespasian or Titus, 69-81, RIC ? (illegible reverse).7. Diva Faustina I, 141, RIC 346bff, (figure standing left).8. Faustina II, 161-75, RIC ? (female standing left).9. Commodus, 180-92, RIC ? (female standing left).10. Clodius Albinus, 194-5, RIC 7.11. Septimius Severus, 196-7, RIC 85 or 88.12. Julia Domna, 196-211, RIC 546.13. Julia Domna, 196-211, RIC 581.14. Septimius Severus, 198, RIC 497a (Laodicea).15. Caracalla, 207, RIC 88.16. Severus Alexander, 222-8, RIC 156.The latest coin is of Severus Alexander, is without much wear. The older coins are heavily worn, suggesting a discrete assemblage that went into the ground together at around the same time as the original hoard.Given their retrieval from a small area, these coins were clearly buried (or lost) as part of a group and so, as silver coins of greater than 300 years antiquity and deposited together, they qualify as Treasure but are not considered part of the original 2004 hoard.",

      "This record refers to 27 silver Roman coins forming two Treasure cases, 2015T221 and 2016T200. They represent addenda to the large Near Dereham hoard, a previously discovered hoard (Treasure case 2004T463). Since 2004, further discoveries have raised the total number of coins recovered from this hoard to 1,126 coins (2006T149, 2008T640, 2010T131 and the two cases reported on here). See PAS record NMS-F33213 for some details of previously found coins, and IARCH-2EC76C.2015T221: Sixteen Roman silver denarii found between February 2010 and July 2011, having been found in the same close area as the original hoard.Catalogue: Individual coin details as follows:1. Marcus Antonius, 32-31BC, Crawford 533 (further details illegible)2. Trajan, 103-17, RIC 119ff.3. Commodus, 184-5, RIC 102.4. Septimius Severus, 193-7, RIC 355ff (Eastern).5.

Julia Mamaea, 222-35, RIC 335.This hoard (the large Near Dereham hoard) was deposited in approximately 241 AD. The date and condition of these sixteen denarii fits neatly with the original coins and there can be no doubt that they represent further survivals from the main Treasure deposit.2016T200: In 2016 a further 11 silver denarii were recovered (2016T200), forming the fifth addenda to hoard 2004T463.Catalogue:Faustina II under Antoninus Pius (AD c.

      "A late fourth century Roman coin hoard consisting of one incomplete and corroded plated copy of a denarius, possibly of Caracalla (AD 193-217), 100 very or extremely worn and corroded copper alloy nummi, many fused together and many unidentifiable, and two late 4th century siliqua in very fine condition. All of these coins were recovered from a small area but no evidence for a (ceramic) vessel was found. It is possible that the two siliqua, which were found together a few feet from the main concentraion, is a separate entity however they have been treated as part of the same assemblage (and would qualify as treasure anyway). The land is frequently waterlogged and boggy and this would explain the condition of the copper alloy coins. The majority of the identifiable coins date from later in the House of Constantine and the House of Valentinian. No copper alloy coins could be confidently dated to post AD 378, so it seems likely that the hoard was buried in the last quarter of the 4th century AD, the siliqua being the last coins deposited sometime after AD 383. The plated denarius of Caracalla is probably a stray coin and not associated with the deposition of the hoard (Richard Abdy pers. comm.). The catalogue can be found below.As there are more than 10 copper alloy coins of over 300 years old from the same findspot this constitutes Treasure under the stipulations of the Act. The two silver coins, which are from the same findspot and over 300 years old also qualify as Treasure, whether as part of the copper alloy hoard or separately.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFind No.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRuler\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tType\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReece Period\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDescription\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMint\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDie axis\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDiameter (mm)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWeight (gms)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRef\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t001\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tValentinian\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSiliqua\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t378-383\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t20\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComplete.

      "Report to H M CoronerA further 3 Roman Silver Coins Found at KINGTON, HEREFORDSHIREBM ref.: 2014-T726 (addenda to 2013-T500)This report will consider these coins with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure act (1996): Namely, their age, precious metal content and whether the coins can be said to come from the same find.Circumstances of discoveryDiscoveredwith the aid of a metal detector on pasture land, February 2-14.Description of FindThe group consists of Roman silver coins (denarii) and begins with a coin of the Emperor Nero struck at the mint of Rome c. AD 66-68. The latest coin is from the reign of the emperor Trajan (AD 98-117). All three coins are similar to those discovered in July 2013 and should be treated as an addendum to the Hadrianic denarius hoard (2013-T500 / HESH-0E0582).SummaryNero (AD 54-68) 1Vespasian (AD 69-79) 1Trajan (AD 98-117) 1The composition appears typical of Roman denarius hoards found in Britain terminating with coins of the second century AD. Although at least one coin older than 100 years was present in the circulation at the time of deposition there is a notable gap of those of the emperors of the first half of the first century AD. These latter were of relatively higher quality silver and were removed during the subsequent period of coinage debasement.CATALOGUENERO (1)Obv.: IMP NE[RO CAESAR AVG ...]No\t\t\tReverse\t\t\tBust\t\t\tBMC\t\t\tRIC\t\t\tQty\t\t\tWeight\t\t12\t\t\tSALVS (in ex.)

The Treasure Act threshold is a minimum of 10% unless ten or more coins of base composition are found together.ConclusionThe Treasure Act requires that a group of coins should 'belong to the same find'. From the mix of coinage described above, it would be safe to assume that this was the case for these coins.On the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins, but not the pottery, belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure.DispositionKington Museum, Herefordshire hope to acquireAuthors:Peter ReavillFinds Liaison Officer - Portable Antiquities SchemeDr Vincent DrostProject Curator - Dept.

      "Circumstances of FindFound with the use of a metal detector in 2014. Coins were scattered in top soil over a large area.Another hoard was previously found on the same field in 2013 (2013 T221 'Holt') with an addenda found in 2014 (2014 T962). Although the present hoard is very similar in its composition to the previous one, it was found sufficiently far away (and also on a slightly different alignment) for it to be likely to be a separate deposit.Description of FindThe earlier coin in the find is a coin of Valerian I (AD 253-260). The latest are two coins struck in AD 281-282, at the end of the reign of Probus (AD 276-282). Most of the coins are dating to the period AD 260-274 when the Empire was divided between the Gallic empire, whose capital was at the city of Trier but which had held dominion over Britain, and the legitimate ('central') Empire in AD 274.",

    notes:
      "Coins (by Vincent Drost):1,857 copper alloy coins: except for one radiate of Claudius II (AD 268-270), the coins are nummi struck from Diocletian's reform in about AD 294 (applied in Britain from AD 296) to the early years of Constantine's rule (AD 306-337). The latest coins in the hoard are reduced nummi struck at 1/48 of the Roman pound from the summer of 307. Two nummi were struck at the London mint in the name of Constantine as Augustus. Constantine became Augustus in December 307 (no. 90). The terminus post quem of the hoard can therefore be dated to that period.The coins were removed from the pot according to 9 successive layers. The stratigraphy suggests that the hoard is made of two distinct groups of coins corresponding to layers 1 to 5 on the one hand and to layers 6 to 9 on the other hand. The two groups present a slightly different composition and terminal date. Layers 6 to 9 have an earlier profile. They contain a larger proportion of coins of the 1st Tetrarchy and no reduced nummi. The latest coin in layers 6 to 9 would be a nummus of the second rule of Maximian struck in c. early 307 (no. 402) and is almost a year earlier the latest coin in layers 1 to 5. Therefore, two different groups of coins - possibly amassed in the continuity one from each other - are likely to have been brought together in a single vessel.This kind of heavy nummi hoard is not very common. Wold Newton is remarkable by its size and could be compared to two other important British hoards of the late 300s: Fyfield, Berkshire (2,106 coins to c. AD 307) and Bridgend, South Wales (1,424 coins to c. AD 309) . The composition of Wold Newton is very similar to that of Fyfield. Both hoards contain a unique radiate and are mostly made of coins dating to the 1st Tetrarchy (87.3% in Wold Newton and 91.0% in Fyfield). The mint distribution is also identical in both hoards: almost half of the coins were minted in Trier (46.7% in Wold Newton and 47.2% in Fyfield), London is the second best represented mint (26.9% and 21.8%) before Lyon (14.6% and 17.2%).Identifier for non-coin objects: Ralph Jackson (BM).Vessel and non-coin objects:- Jar, the container for the coin hoard, with copper-alloy corrosion products and 'coin halos' visible on the inner surface. A near-complete wheel-thrown grey ware jar with a pair of countersunk lugged handles. The rim, completely lacking from the pot, is represented by several loose non-joining sherds. The surfaces are grey-coloured, the fabric hard and fine-textured with a very pale grey core. Decoration comprises a panel of vertical scoring in the area of maximum girth flanked top and bottom by plain horizontal bands and a simple incised continuous scrolled motif in the upper (handle) zone. Ht. 28.5 cm. Diam. 20 cm.This is Crambeck Grey Ware, the most abundant of the Crambeck wares, distributed across NE England during the early to mid- 4th century with a major expansion from the mid- 4th century (Tyers 1999, 188-9).Date: 4th century AD.- Dish, broken. A small plain shallow-sided wheel-thrown grey ware dish with a flat base and simple rim. The circuit of the walls is complete in nine joining sherds but the base is represented by a single sherd. The surfaces are pale grey-coloured, the fabric hard and fine-textured with a very pale white-grey core. Rim diameter c. 15 cm. Wall height c. 3 cm.Crambeck Grey Ware.Date: 4th century AD.- Sherd, thick-walled, from the lower wall/ base angle of a large hand-formed gritted grey-black coarseware jar.

      "Treasure case 2013 T763.The Seaton Down Hoard consists of approximately 22,000 copper alloy coins, essentially nummi dating to the AD 330s and early 340s, and bearing the effigies of Constantine I and his family. This is one of the largest hoards of its kind within the whole Roman Empire.Circumstances of find (based upon the excavation report by Alex Farnell)The hoard was found on 16 November 2013 whilst metal detecting with the permission of the landowner near Seaton, Devon. Coins were exposed and partially recovered by the finder. The finder contacted the East Devon Metal Detecting club, whose members informed the PAS FLO Danielle Wootton and the Devon County Archaeologist Bill Horner. An archaeological excavation was commissioned by Devon County Council and undertaken by AC archaeology between the 18th and 22nd November 2013 in order to recover the bulk of the find.A 3m2 area around the find spot was exposed. Coins were removed and bagged in two centimetres spits according to a twenty centimetre grid overlaying the area. The coins formed a single coherent group deposited in a small isolated pit although the possibility of different episodes of deposition has to be considered (note for instance the two concreted lumps of coins within the main deposit). The presence of a possible container was suggested by a number of ferrous fragments around the main coin deposit and by fragmentary remains of possible organic fabric preserved below the coins at the base of the pit. The irregular and lozenge shaped form of the coin deposit suggests a flexible container, perhaps a fabric or soft leather bag.Description of the coinsThe coins range from the AD 260s to the AD 340s. The main denomination, generally known today as a nummus (plural nummi), is predominantly made of copper-alloy with a tiny admixture of silver. There are also a handful of earlier base metal coins of the 3rd century AD, representing the residue of the earlier coinage system based on the denomination generally known today as the 'radiate'.99% of the hoard consist of the very common issues struck between AD 330 and AD 341 (mostly the Gloria Exercitus type in the name of Constantine and his sons Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans as well as the Urbs Roma and Constantinopolis commemorative issues). The heavier nummi struck before 330 were hardly available by the time of the hoarding and are therefore very few in number. The group terminates during the joint reign of Constantius II and his younger brother Constans. Constans was the last legitimate emperor to visit Britain in AD 343.The latest coins in the hoard are three nummi bearing the reverse legend VICTORIAE DD AVGGQ NN struck in Trier during the first issue following the creation of this type. According to RIC, the 'Two Victories' reverse type was struck in AD 347-8 but some scholars lean towards an earlier date in the 340s.17 mints are represented within the find. The London mint was shut down in AD 325 and Britain's was from that moment on mainly supplied by the Gallic mints which provide 95% of the coins (Trier and, to a lesser extent, Lyon and Arles). There is also a small quantity of ancient forgeries (c. 3%) listed below as 'irregular'.Such Constantinian period hoards are not uncommon, especially in Britain. However, Seaton Down is one of the largest of its kind within the whole Roman Empire. Some similar giant British hoards such as Nether Compton, Dorset (22,703 specimens) or Bishopswood, Hertfordshire (17,548 specimens) are recorded but they were dispersed without any detailed publication.The Seaton Down Hoard is currently being studied at the British Museum.Summary (by date and mint):Date\t\t\tLondon\t\t\tGaul I & II\t\t\tTrier\t\t\tLyon\t\t\tArles\t\t\tRome\t\t\tTicinum\t\t\tAquileia\t\t\tSiscia\t\t\tOther Eastern\t\t\tUncertain\t\t\tTotal\t\t260-274\t\t\t0\t\t\t5\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t3\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t8\t\t310-313\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t3\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t3\t\t313-317\t\t\t1\t\t\t0\t\t\t1\t\t\t1\t\t\t2\t\t\t1\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t2\t\t\t8\t\t317-324\t\t\t1\t\t\t0\t\t\t4\t\t\t3\t\t\t0\t\t\t4\t\t\t1\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t48\t\t\t5\t\t\t66\t\t324-330\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t20\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t2\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t2\t\t\t0\t\t\t24\t\t330-335\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t9383\t\t\t3215\t\t\t1821\t\t\t309\t\t\t0\t\t\t62\t\t\t199\t\t\t230\t\t\t1797\t\t\t17016\t\t335-341\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t2277\t\t\t274\t\t\t153\t\t\t9\t\t\t0\t\t\t7\t\t\t13\t\t\t7\t\t\t806\t\t\t3546\t\t341-348\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t3\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t0\t\t\t3\t\tIrregular\t\t\t-\t\t\t-\t\t\t-\t\t\t-\t\t\t-\t\t\t-\t\t\t-\t\t\t-\t\t\t-\t\t\t-\t\t\t-\t\t\t597\t\tTotal\t\t\t2\t\t\t5\t\t\t11691\t\t\t3493\t\t\t1976\t\t\t328\t\t\t1\t\t\t69\t\t\t212\t\t\t287\t\t\t2610\t\t\t21271\t\tOther Material (identification by Ralph Jackson)Three large, heavy pieces of iron were associated with the coins. The form and size of all three indicates that they were almost certainly made and deposited together. Radiography of nos. 1 and 2 demonstrates their density, clarifies their shape and reveals a slight irregular cleft in the broader end of no. 2. All three are lightly ridged and have a sub-rectangular cross-section. No. 1 has two tapered terminals; nos. 2 and 3 have one broad and one narrow terminal. Although a little irregular the terminals may all be complete, as made. All three pieces are essentially large blocks of iron and their weight and simplicity of form suggest they are almost certainly prepared blooms of smelted iron - 'ingots' - the raw material of blacksmiths, ready for hand-forging into wrought iron objects. Other examples of Romano-British prepared blooms weigh between about 1 to 10 kg.Date: Not intrinsically datable but their general form is consistent with blooms of Roman date. Weight: (1) (lightest) 2.04 kg; (2) (heaviest), (3) - both over 3 kg.Consideration as TreasureChronologically the coins belong to one coinage system and form a discrete compositional group of coins that would have been current in Britain around the middle of the fourth century AD. The coins formed a single coherent group deposited in a small isolated pit.",

      "The coins were washed by the Department of Conservation and Scientific Research of the British Museum, under the supervision of Metals Conservator Pippa Pearce. The exact total is uncertain due to two fused blocks estimated from their weight (2491 g and 880 g) to contain more than 1,000 coins. Added up to the 21,271 coins sorted by date and mint, the total number of coins is between 22,000 and 23,000.The millionth object recorded on the PAS Database is a coin belonging to the hoard. This is coin no. 1,061 in the sequence, as it happens a nummus struck in AD 332 at the mint of Lyon (Gaul). It shows the personification of Constantinopolis on the obverse and a Victory on prow on the reverse. This very common type was struck by Constantine the Great across the Empire to celebrate the inauguration of the new city of Constantinople which was to become the capital of the Eastern Empire.",

      "The following is an edited version of two reports written by Dr Richard AbdyDescription of the findMany of the coins were buckled or fragmentary; probably damaged by ploughing, as their broken edges looked fresh. The latest coin is not fully legible but probably takes the hoard just into the joint reign of Honorius and Arcadius. If so this sole specimen would place Thruxton near the beginning of the sizable body of British siliqua hoards, which end with the period 395-402. Furthermore, the siliquae in this hoard are virtually unclipped (&#39;clipping factor 1&#39; just possible on one specimen) and this, together with the presence of miliarenses alongside the siliquae, supports an earlier date for the deposition of the hoard, before the AD 395-402 coinage had much chance to spread into the circulation. (For the compositional changes of late Roman silver hoards over time, including the spread of the phenomenon of clipping, see P. Guest in CHRB X, &#39;Hoards from the End of Roman Britain&#39;, pp.411-23).Catalogue(Note: the norm during the late empire was for colleges of two or more emperors, at least one in the east and one in the west. Mints usually stuck coins honouring the other emperor(s) as well as of their particular territory).5 silver miliarenses:AD 355-60, Constantius II &amp; Julian, 1 (mint = Arles)AD 364-7, Valentinian I &amp; Valens, 1 (mint = Rome)AD 367-75, Valentinian I, Valens &amp; Gratian, 1 (mint = Trier)AD 378/9-88, Gratian, Theodosius I, Valentinian II, Arcadius, Magnus Maximus &amp; Flavius Victor, 1 (mint = Lyon)AD 388-92, Theodosius I, Valentinian II, Eugenius &amp; Arcadius, 1 (mint = Lyon)36 silver siliquaeAD 355-63, Constantius II &amp; Julian, 1 (mint = Arles)AD 364-7, Valentinian I &amp; Valens, 8 (mint = Trier x 7; Rome x 1)AD 375-8, Valens, Gratian &amp; Valentinian II, 3 (mint = Trier x 1; Lyon x 2)AD 378/9-88, Gratian, Theodosius I, Valentinian II, Arcadius, Magnus Maximus &amp; Flavius Victor, 11 (mint = Trier x 7; Aquileia x 1; uncertain x 3)AD 388-95, Theodosius I, Valentinian II, Eugenius &amp; Arcadius, 6 (mint = Trier x 3; uncertain x 3)AD 395-402, Honorius &amp; Arcadius, 1 (mint = Milan)Uncertain period fragments, 6ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being precious metal coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than two pieces.",

Due to the state of most of the coins, it is not possible to determine the emperor named in the legends so the coins are attributed to a general period of the House of Constantine.

      'Treasure case 2014 T543: disclaimed, returned to finder.Kingsdon, SOMERSET2 AR siliquae to c. AD 364 Circumstances of discoveryThe hoard was found by Mr. [redacted] in 2014, prior to 13th August 2014, whilst metal-detecting on pasture that had previously been disturbed. The two coins were found at a depth of c. 2-3" in the same field, amongst a large number of contemporary coins in base metal.Description of the findThe find consists of two silver siliquae. The latest coin is, notably, a contemporary copy of Jovian issued c. AD 363-364; this is commented on below by Sam Moorhead. Both coins are damaged, but appear to be unclipped.Silver siliquae for Jovian from Lyon are very rare. RIC records them with the mintmark PLVG* (RIC VIII, p. 196, no. 241). However, the Whitwell hoard (1992) coin and PAS SUSS-F74487 are two examples of coins with LVG. PLVG is not recorded. Furthermore, and most importantly, the style of this coin, notably the reverse lettering, is crude. However, still a very interesting coin which appears to be of a reasonable silver content.CATALOGUENotesThe following abbreviations are used for the names of the rulers:JA Julian AugustusJv JovianBusts as RIC VIII:C Cuirassed 1 no diademD Draped & cuirassed 3 pearl-diademed, 4 rosette-diademedCF1-4 = degrees of clipping evidentSILVER: SILIQUAE (2)355-364, Trier (1)\t\t\tMINT\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrier\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLyon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRome\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAqu.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSirm.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThess.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnt.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnc.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t355-364\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIrregular\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObv\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tM.-m.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoxne\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC VIII\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCF\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\tJA/D3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVOTIS V MVLTIS X\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTR branch\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t135\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t365\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.56[1]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\tIrregular c. 363-364, Lyon (1)\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObv\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tM.-m.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoxne\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC VIII\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWt.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCF\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\tJv/D3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVOT V MVLT X\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPLVG\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.42[2]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t[1] Possibly plated[2] Incomplete and bent',

      "DiscussionThe termination date of this hoard makes it one of the latest to have been recovered from the north-west counties, a point emphasised by the fact that eight of the twenty-three coins were issued from the mid-370s onwards.Only one other hoard of siliquae of the late fourth century has been recorded from the North West - that consisting of 401 coins, ranging in date from Constantius II to Honorius, which is said to have been found at Rossall Point (near Fleetwood in Lancashire) in the 1840s. This hoard is now in the collection of the Harris Museum in Preston. However, there are difficulties regarding the true provenance of this hoard:D. Shotter",

      "2012 T661 South Warwickshire addendaReport to HM CoronerCircumstances of discoveryOne silver denarius was discovered on 16th August 2012 during an archaeological excavation of the site of the 2008 find of the South Warwickshire hoard (2008 T410). The coin was buried at a depth of about 10-15cm. The original find was made in a pot about 4m to the north-east of the location of this recent discovery.Four further denarii were found in September 2012 during the same archaeological investigation of the hoard site and an associated Roman period wall, at the same depth in old ploughsoil. Two were found on 3rd September and 11th September, one on 4th September, and another on 4th September.The coinsThe coins are all silver Roman coins of the denomination known as a denarius (plural denarii) (four Roman Republican (dating from 128 BC to 42 BC) and one Roman Imperial denarius of Claudius I dated to AD 50-51).",

      "The coins satisfy the terms of the Treasure Act with regard to age and metal content. They are certainly more than 300 years old and have a precious metal content well in excess of the 10% required.On the balance of probabilities, I conclude that they constitute a prima facie case of treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996), by being part of a group of two or more precious metal coins of the same find. The coins are consistent with the type and date range of the coins in the original find and should be considered as addenda to it.",

      "Treasure case 2014 T194: disclaimed, returned to findersCircumstances of FindFound while metal-detecting on four separate occasions by Mr [redacted] (09/03/14, 11/03/14, 06/07/14, 09/07/14) and Mr [redacted] (29/06/14).Description of FindThe find consists of 6 silver coins of the second century AD. They are all denarii (which had been the principle Roman silver denomination during the first two centuries of Roman Britain). The final coin in the group dates to the rule of Severus Alexander, giving a TPQ of AD 235 for the group.The coins were found spread over some distance. Coins 3, 4 and 5 in particular were separated from the others by modern field boundaries, a steep slope and a modern road. However the distance between the two groups is only 125 metres at the shortest and 250 metres at the greatest and it is suggested the coins in the lower field could have spread down there before the modern road and boundaries were in place. However, other contemporary silver coins found in the wider area have been discounted, as discussed below.Summary denarii Septimius Severus (AD 193-211) 2Caracalla (AD 198-217) -Julia Domna 2Elagabalus (AD 218-222) -Julia Maesa 1Severus Alexander (AD 222-35) 1Total 6It is noted that three further denarii have been recorded from the fields lying to the east of the fields in which these six coins were found. These are coins of Caracalla, Julia Maesa (probably) and Maximinus I, and are detailed separately in the filed report and catalogues seperately on this database. Though they fall within the date range given by the group of six they are separated both by distance (over 1km in one case), an upward slope, and by modern field boundaries. A small valley which partially lies between the closest of these three (that of ?Julia Maesa) and the main group would also suggest spread though ploughing and ground movement is less likely. They are therefore interpreted as site finds within a background of contemporary coin loss in these fields and are not considered part of the group.CATALOGUEdenariiWARS OF THE SUCCESSION (2)SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS (2)Rome (1)Obv (xxx): L SEPT SEV PERT AVG IMP VII\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\tBust\t\t\t\t\t\tBMC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRIC\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\tWt.\t\t1\t\t\tARAB ADIAB COS II P P (Victory adv. l. holding wreath and trophy)\t\t\tA1*\t\t\txxx\t\t\t64\t\t\t1\t\t\t2.3[1]\t\tEastern Mint (1)Obv (6): IMP CAE L SEP SEV PERT AVG COS IINo.\t\t\tReverse\t\t\tBust\t\t\tBMC\t\t\tRIC\t\t\tQty.\t\t\tWt.\t\t2\t\t\tVICT AVG (or similar) (Victory adv./stg. l. holding wreath and palm).\t\t\tA1*\t\t\tcf.xxx\t\t\tcf.425\t\t\t1\t\t\t2.3[2]\t\tJOINT REIGN OF SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS AND CARACALLA (2)JULIA DOMNA (2)Obv (4): IVLIA AVGVSTANo.\t\t\tReverse\t\t\tBust\t\t\tBMC\t\t\tRIC\t\t\tQty.\t\t\tWt.\t\t3\t\t\tHILARITAS (Hilaritas stg. l., holding palm and sceptre\t\t\t\t\t\tE1*\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\txxx\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t555\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.02[3] (incomplete)\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\tPIETAS AVGG (Pietas stg.

      "Two silver denarii, both in relatively crisp condition. Apart from siliquae from the second half of the 4th century and nummi from the 330s onwards, no other Roman coins have so far been found in this field. This fact, combined with the closeness of these two coins to one another in date and condistion, makes it very likely that they went into the ground together, either as part of a purse loss or a larger, concealed hoard. The two coins are:1. Silver denarius of Elagabalus, Rome, reverse P M TR P IIII COS III P P, Sol advancing left with whip, star in left field, RIC IV.2, 40, weight 2.68g, AD2212. Silver denarius of Severus Alexander, Rome, reverse P M TR P II COS P P, Pax standing left with olive branch and sceptre, RIC IV.2, 27, weight 2.02g, AD223The loss or deposition of these two coins most probably falls, given their condition, in the 220s or 230s",

      "Four base silver radiates fused together in a pile. Given this feature they clearly entered the ground in a similar position and, since they are of base silver, they furnish a case of Treasure. The only legible portions are provided by the face visible at each end of the pile, an obverse of Postumus from his Principal Mint and another of Gallienus from the Gallic Mint operating in the late 250s (with a GALLIENVS.P.F.AVG legend, radiate and cuirassed bust right). Both coins are in sharp condition with little wear and the loss or deposition most probably occurred in the 260s.Three more fused coins from the same area found in September 2014 probably represent more coins from the same hoard and push the date of deposition later into the mid-270s or beyond. These are argentiferous copper alloy radiates of the later Gallic emperor, one of Tetricus II (AD273-4) and the other of Tetricus I (the LAETITIA AVGG/N reverse is visible). The central coin, of course, is not visible. Hoards containing these radiates are very common and date from the mid-270s until the mid-280s.Weight 17.57g.",

      "A small hoard of eleven Roman copper alloy coins. Please see Treasure report below for details.The coinsAll the coins are second and early third century AD brass denominations known as sestertii and have received a considerable amount of circulation wear (sing. = sestertius).The group stretches from the Emperor Hadrian (AD 117-38) to the Severan period covering the first quarter of the following century (the latest datable coin is from AD 224; the third regnal year of the emperor Severus Alexander, AD 222-35). The group can be summarised as follows:Summary:Hadrian (AD 117-38) 1Antoninus Pius (AD 138-61) 2Aurelius Caesar 1Marcus Aurelius (AD 161-80) 3Faustina II 2Wars of the Succession (AD 193-7):Julia Domna 1Severus Alexander (AD 222-235) 1 (TRP III; AD 224)Total 11Metal Content and AgeThe coins satisfy the terms of the Treasure Act with regard to age and quantity, being base metal coins over than 300 years old and more than ten pieces.Of the same find?The composition of issues and their relative degrees of circulation wear fit well with that which might be expected for a small hoard of Roman bronzes deposited in the third century AD.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being base-metal coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces.",

      "Boldre, Hampshire, 1608 radiates to AD 274The earliest coin in the find is of Trebonianus Gallus (AD 249-51). The latest was struck in AD 276, towards the end of the reign of Tacitus (AD 275-6). Most of the coins date to the period AD 260-274 when the Empire was divided between the Gallic empire, whose capital was at the city of Trier but which had held dominion over Britain, and the legitimate ('central') Empire in AD 274.Summary by reign:Central EmpireTrebonianus Gallus (AD 249-51), 1Joint reign of Valerian & Gallienus (AD 253-60)Valerian I, 8Gallienus, 1Salonina, 1Sole reign of Gallienus (AD 260-8)Gallienus 204 Salonina, 19Claudius II (AD 268-70), 161Divus Claudius, 11Quintillus (AD 270), 17Aurelian (AD 270-5), 2Tacitus (AD 275-6), 1Gallic EmpirePostumus (AD 260-9), 36Marius (AD 269), 3Victorinus (AD 269-71), 391Divus Victorinus, 2Tetricus I (AD 271-4), 520Tetricus II, 189Uncertain emperor (AD 260-274), 6Barbarous radiatesClaudius II / Divus Claudius prototypes, 15Aurelian prototype, 1Gallic Empire prototypes, 19Total 1608The pottery containerFound with the coins were fifteen sherds (one base, the rest body; no rim sherds) of a globular vessel, probably a flagon, composed of a pink fabric with small red inclusions and a brownish-red slipped surface. There is at least one band of rouletting on the outside. Impressions of coins are still visible on the inside of the sherds. There is no question that this is the container for the coin hoard and thus qualifies as part of the same treasure deposit.",

    notes:
      "Description of the coinsThe majority of the coins present were minted between AD 313 and 340, and are a denomination commonly known as the nummus (nummi pl.). (A small number of older coins of the later third century are also present: they represent the chance survival of an older coin type - the radiate - in the circulation.) The coins were produced at a number of mints around the empire (with an expected bias towards those within, or closest to, Britain). The final coins of the group were produced a couple of years either side of the death of Constantine the Great (AD 306-337), the first Christian Roman Emperor.No container was found with the coins but traces of textile in the corrosion product of one coin suggest they were within a sack or bag.From the same find?The coins were likely to have been in circulation at the time of burial, with the bulk of material (from the AD 330s) close to the termination date of the final coins; a typical circulation pattern. The two corroded lead tesserae (tickets or tokens of uncertain function) which were also recovered could also have formed part of the assemblage as this class of object has occasionally appeared in reports of previous Roman coin hoard finds.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins were buried together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being bronze coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces. The lead tesserae, by virtue of their association, should be considered likewise.Richard AbdyDept. of Coins and MedalsBritish Museum",

      "A late Roman copper alloy nummi hoard (TBKA 'the Pewsey coin hoard') contained within a sooted grey-ware type jar. Total coins = 2384, deposited c. AD 348. Contents: Two base metal radiates and 2382 base metal nummi: Radiates: Claudius II (AD 268-70), 1; Tetricus I (AD 271-4), 1. Nummi: AD 317-24, (1 half nummus of Trier); AD 330s, (1 'Milvian Bridge' nummus fraction of Constantinople); AD 330-35, 171; AD 335-41, 911; AD 341-8, 1165; uncertain brockages, 2; uncertain/illegible, 42 (incl. 14 fused); irregular nummi 54Estimated coins: 3000. The vessel was buried in a small pit and covered with several large, roughly hewn limestone blocks. These are not local stones as the suface geology here is clay-with-flints.Sixty-nine coins or parts thereof were collected by the finder, the rest remained in the vessel. Several vessel sherd, mostly the rim and the upper part of the vessel, were also recovered by the finder. The vessel is heavily sooted, showing that it was probably used as a domestic cooking vessel prior to be used as a container for the coins. The stone covering of the hoard suggests deliberate concealment; the stones may have been a marker however it is unclear if these would have been visible or if they too were buried. The hoard was stabilised in-situ then block lifted for excavation in the lab.( During the table top excavation in the British Museum, remains of fur/hide and lead foil were found over the undisturbed upper parts of the coin hoard. Though the surface coins inside the pot had been disrupted in many places, there was enough left in situ to show that the lead foil had been laid over the coins and then, on top of that, a piece of fur/hide had been placed, hairy side down. There was no evidence that the lead foil had been wrapped around the coins or that the fur/hide was part of a bag. Both layers seem to have been used as a cap or bung, with some remaining evidence that they extended upwards, up the inside of the pot wall, rather than downwards, between the coins and the pot wall. P Pearce 24.5.2019.)Most of the pit cut had been removed however a small amount of pit fill was recovered.",

      "Treasure case 2013 T380 (addendum to case 2012 T510). A collection of 51 Roman coins, comprising 22 silver denarii and 29 antoniniani. The coins vary in condition from extremely fine to poor, with many antoniniani being covered with copper corrosion. The coins date from the reign of Caracalla in the early third century (AD 208) through to the radiate issues of Victorinus. There is only one gap in the coin sequence, a gap of 11 years between AD 229 and AD 240. There is one possible denarius of Marcus Aurelius (AD 161-180). The majority of the coins were minted in Rome (25), with the other mints including Lyon (4), Antioch? (2), Milan? (1), Trier (1) and a further 18 coins as yet unattributed.Two pieces of pottery, one probably late Iron Age (100 BC - AD 100), and a very worn piece of Roman 'grey' ware were recovered within the coin scatter. Two cojoined copper rings, one large, one small, were also recovered however it is uncertain if these objects are associated with the hoard or not.001 Caracalla. den.

      "Thirty coins are present in the group shown at the British Museum; although one is just a tiny fragment (0.28g compared to a normal weight of a whole specimen of around 2-3g). They were all silver Roman coins of the denomination known as the denarius (plural denarii), issued in the names of the emperors (and occasionally their empresses and 'Caesars', or heirs to the throne) over the course of much of the first - second centuries AD. The composition is typical of a denarius hoard buried in the early AD 160s, under the Antonine dynasty. The earliest coin was a well-worn issue of the short lived emperor Vitellius who perished in the Civil Wars of AD 69 (the 'year of the four emperors'). The latest closely dated coin is of Lucius Verus from the first year of his joint reign with the more famous emperor Marcus Aurelius: AD 161, a year with probably saw the issue of the deified Antonius Pius type also present. The lifetime issue of Marcus's wife Faustina II is less closely datable since it could have been produced up to her death in AD 176 (but does not otherwise contradict the general impression of a typical Antonine period hoard just stretching into the early years of the reign of Marcus Aurelius, AD 161-80).Full catalogue on file at British Museum",

      "Treasure case 2012 T520: Two coins donated to the British Museum, remainder disclaimedCircumstances of findTwo groups of Roman coins were found on 21 July 2012 by three people detecting on ploughed farmland near Martock, Somerset. The finders excavated the groups at the time of finding and subsequently reported them to the Portable Antiquities Scheme. The coins (418 coins) from the two groups were bagged together and mixed before being handed in and so are catalogued together. The PAS and Somerset County Council Historic Environment Service were able to arrange re-excavation of the findspot (full report to follow). The find was reported as Treasure to HM coroner via the Portable Antiquities Scheme.The subsequent archaeological excavation recovered seven further coins (one a fragment) from the soil around the original deposition and some pottery sherds. The seven coins are all of similar types and date to the main groups and are likely to be associated. The excavation and examination of the pottery retrieved by the finders suggested the main group was contained in a ceramic jar probably covered by an upturned bowl. The top of the main group had almost certainly been hit by the plough at some point, damaging the pots and possibly scattering a few coins as well as leaving a clear plough scar in the adjacent ditch fill. The lack of a wide scatter of coins around the hoard, and the low number of broken coins, suggests the coins were mostly unaffected by this damage.The finders reported that the larger group was covered by pieces of sandstone when found, with a large piece of local blue lias adjacent. They reported that the coins were not held in the pot, which was broken, but were coming up in groups and rouleaux of 5-6 coins. The hoard or hoards had been buried within a ditch filled with occupation debris including a range of pottery. Undisturbed ditch fill between the two holes made by the finders and their report of the position of the stones, suggest the two groups of coins were originally buried separately rather than the smaller group simply being the upper part of the main group turned over by the plough. The narrow date range of all the coins does not rule out the two groups being buried at the same time and the placement certainly suggests the burial of one group was informed by the placement of the other.The coins were washed in the method recommended by the British Museum conservation department but have not undergone full mechanical cleaning and conservation. It is likely that full cleaning would allow more detailed identification of the coins and would separate some coins currently cemented together in pairs.Description of the coinsThe coins date to between AD 317-330, and the coins are a standard base metal denomination known as a nummus (pl. nummi). The coins can be grouped into two main periods: AD 317-24 was dominated by two personalities: Constantine the Great (AD 306-37) the first Christian emperor and his pagan rival Licinius (AD 308-24). Following the latter's defeat, the second period AD 324-330 falls within the reign of Constantine as sole senior emperor, together with his sons holding the rank of Caesar (junior emperors).The majority could be identified to reverse type and most could be identified to RIC number. A full catalogue is available from the Somerset FLO. Only 34 could not be identified to type and therefore dated, but the obverse styles fit within this period. The final coin was produced between AD 327 and 328. The great majority of the coins (94%) date from AD 318 to 324. The exclusion of any earlier coins is typical of hoards of this period. The absence of later types (such as the very common Gloria Exercitus with two standards) suggests that the coins were deposited before AD 330-1.Eight mints are represented: London accounts for 59% of the identifiable coins, Trier 34%. This number of London coins is an unusually high proportion for the period (compared for example to the Shrewsbury Hoard 2009 T450) and probably reflects the both the strength of this mint in the AD 317-324 period and the high number of BEATA TRANQVILLITAS types. 29% of the identified coins were Globe on Altar (BEATA TRANQVILLITAS / BEAT TRANQLITAS) designs from London, however these represented 42 different types suggesting the coins were drawn from general circulation rather than being a batch from the mint. The coins include a few bust varieties and unrecorded officinae. A summary of the coins is given below.Given the above discussion of the probability of the coins originally being buried in two groups the coins were examined to consider if their types or condition would allow the groups to be separated. The coins in general are all very good with little wear although some have copper concretions and iron pan on them from the burial environment. While some are later, the dates are continuous with no clear break into two groups and they are likely to all have circulated together.Summary (by date and mint):\t\t\tLondon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrier\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLyon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRome\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTicinum\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAquileia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSiscia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThessal-onica\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncert-ain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t317-324\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t192\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t54\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t367\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t324-330\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t15\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t24\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIlleg\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t34\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t34\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t200\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t114\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t11\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t88\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t425\t\t\t\t\tPottery associated with the coins A full report of the pottery handed in with the coins by the finders and that retrieved by the re-excavation is available fromt he Somerset FLO. The main group of coins appear to have been buried in a Black Burnished Ware jar with a dish of similar fabric covering the top. Both are very common vessels in the area and contemporaneous with the coins. This is the same burial arrangement found in the earlier Frome Hoard. There are no vessels definitely associated with the smaller group although there is a possibility two dishes are present in sherds handed in by the finders.Other MaterialA range of iron, copper-alloy and lead items were found in the topsoil above and around the deposition point, mostly nails with one hooked fitting. They are not unambiguously Roman and cannot certainly be associated with the hoard.A farthing of Charles II was also handed in with the coins which was found in the topsoil above the hoard and is clearly not associated.Consideration as TreasureThese coins belong to a narrow period of time and form a discrete compositional group. This would suggest that they are all from one find, representing an individual's unrecovered savings deposited together as a hoard.All the coins are an argentiferous copper-alloy. However, as they are only about 5% silver or less they should be considered essentially bronze.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being bronze coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces. The Roman pottery fragments by virtue of their association with the coins should be considered likewise.Richard Abdy, Dept. of Coins and Medals, British Museum, 07 January 2014Laura Burnett, Somerset FLO, November 2013",

      "Circumstances of FindFound on 1st December 2013 with the aid of metal detectors on cultivated land. One coin was found on the surface and the deepest was found at a depth of eight to ten centimeters. The coins were dispersed but found in a small area which also produced a small sherd of Romano-British greyware and a first century AD Colchester type brooch, both probably unrelated to the fourth century AD coins.Description of the coinsThis group consists of 15 coins made in the fourth century AD. Each coin, generally known today as a nummus, is predominantly copper-alloy with a tiny admixture of silver. In fact all but two were produced under the reign of the usurper emperor Magnentius (AD 350-3). Magnentius, who was partly of British descent managed to take control of the whole western half of the empire, making his subsequent defeat financially and politically chaotic. One coin in the hoard is an irregular copy, one of many forgeries which flourished in the numismatic record during the AD 350s. The final coin of the group is of a later emperor of the west, Gratian (AD 367-83), produced a couple of decades later. On the balance of probabilities it is treated here as part of the hoard, although it should be noted that with such a statistically small group of coins it remains possible that it represents a stray (or unrelated) find from an area that has produced Roman finds from various periods.Summary by mint (if identifiable) \t\t\t\t\t\tAmiens\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrier\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMagnentius \t\t\t(AD 350-3)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGratian \t\t\t(AD367-83)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIrregular\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t15\t\t\t\t\tFrom the same find?Chronologically the coins belong to one coinage system and form a discrete compositional group of coins that would have been briefly current in Britain around the middle of the fourth century AD.",

      "Ranging in date from AD c.270-317 the majority of coins from the group chronologically straddles the Tetrarchic period of late Roman history, from AD 294, and the midpoint in the career of the first Christian emperor Constantine the Great (AD 307-37) which would end in his achievement of absolute power over the empire.Two types of late Roman base metal denominations are present in the Claverley deposit - both representing multiples of the classical Roman currency unit, the denarius (their precise value remains subject to debate). The first coin type is the late third century radiate, so called due to the imperial effigy represented crowned by the sun's rays. The second appeared by the turn of the century, a larger denarius multiple which replaced the radiate in the fourth century, the nummus (pl. nummi).Summary:Radiates:Victorinus or Tetricus I (AD 269-4), 1Reign of Carausius (AD 286-93), 2Uncertain (270s-90s), 1Nummi by mint and period:-\t\t\tLondon\t\t\tTrier\t\t\tOthers\t\t\tUncertain\t\t\tTotal\t\tAD 294-313\t\t\t6\t\t\t3\t\t\t-\t\t\t4\t\t\t13\t\tAD 313-7\t\t\t3\t\t\t-\t\t\t1\t\t\t-\t\t\t4\t\tTotal\t\t\t9\t\t\t3\t\t\t1\t\t\t4\t\t\t17\t\tThe nummi in particular belong to a short-lived currency system and represent two stages in the decline in module of the nummus from the size of a modern two pound coin at its first incarnation, AD 294-306 to the size of a one pence piece by AD 317.

HESH-91B963Circumstances of DiscoveryFound by Messrs Martin Fulloway and Jeremy Daw with the aid of a metal detector with subsequent excavation carried out by FLO (Peter Reavill). Although very close groupings were recorded by the archaeological investigation, little compositional difference was noted between each section and only the major 'clump' groupings are noted in the catalogue.No pottery was found with the coins but there was evidence that the hoard had once been contained within cloth pouches contained within leather bag(s) since a number of surviving fragments of leather had been preserved by the copper alloy corrosion products. A number of preserved leaves were also discovered within the corrosion productsDate of latest coinsSee Normanby. Leominster is similar in composition and likewise contains the earliest phases of both Carausian marked series, L and C.Summary:Central EmpireJoint reign of Valerian & Gallienus (AD 253-60)Salonina 1Sole reign of Gallienus (AD 260-8) 58Salonina 2Claudius II (AD 268-70) 55Divus Claudius (AD 270) 16Quintillus (AD 270) 7Aurelian (AD 270-5) 2Tacitus (AD 275-6) 3Probus (AD 276-82) 4Joint reign of Diocletian & Maximian (AD 285-93)Maximian 1 (2nd series Lyon = AD 286)Gallic EmpirePostumus (AD 260-9) 7Marius (AD 269) 1Victorinus (AD 269-71) 89Divus Victorinus (AD 271) 1Tetricus I (AD 271-4) 186Tetricus II 71Irregular 6British EmpireCarausius (AD 286-93) 8",

An addendum of a further 8 coins found in September and October 2014 is listed separately after the first group. They do not alter the interpretation of the hoard below in any way.As mentioned, most of the coins are corroded but it can be seen that their condition when they went into the ground was evidently very good. Given this lack of wear it is very tempting to connect the deposition of this coin hoard (assuming we are not dealing with an accidental purse loss) with the reconquest of Britain by Constantius Chlorus in 296. Certainly, given the demonetisation of these radiates in 296, the hoard cannot date to very much later.Note: Image number in file names does not relate to the catalogue for coins 1 - 14. This was an arbitrary number assigned before the catalogue was written. Coins 15 - 22 the catalogue number and image file name do correspond.[Sam Moorhead note: this hoard contains British Empire coins]",

      "Treasure case 2013 T179: Acquired by the Museum of Somerset.For full catalogue and details of the excavation please contact the Somerset FLO.The find consists of 3335 base silver coins of the second and third centuries AD. 165 of which are denarii (which had been the principle Roman denomination during the first two centuries of Roman Britain) and the rest are radiates, the denarius-multiple (probably a double denarius) first introduced in AD 215 and which began to take over as the main denomination in the course of the third century. In addition, there are four large brass coins of a denomination known as a sestertius: four such sestertii being the equivalent value of one silver denarius.The final coins in the group date to about AD 270, a time when Roman Britain was part of a group of rebellious provinces under the rule of a rival 'emperor' (to the one in Italy) sometimes called the 'Gallic Empire.'Summary denarii radiates sestertiiAntoninus Pius (AD 138-61) 1 - -Marcus Aurelius (AD 161-80) - - -Faustina II - - 1Lucilla - - 2Commodus (AD 180-92) - - 1Septimius Severus (AD 193-211) 15 -Caracalla (AD 198-217) 14 -Julia Domna 4 2Geta Caesar 1 -Macrinus (AD 217-8) 1 -Elagabalus (AD 218-222) 39 8Julia Soemias 6 -Julia Maesa 10 -Aquilia Severa 2 -Severus Alexander (AD 222-35) 49 -Julia Mamaea 11 -Orbiana 1 -Maximinus I (AD 235-8) 7 -Maximus 2 -Pupienus (AD 238) - 1Gordian III (AD 238-44) 2 467Philip I (AD 244-9) - 282Otacilia Severa - 66Philip II (Caesar) - 40Philip II (Augustus) - 27Decius (AD 249-51) - 93Herennia Etruscilla - 52Herennius Etruscus - 25Hostilian (Caesar) - 7Divus Vespasian - 1Divus Titus - 2Divus Trajan - 1Divus Pius - 1Divus Severus - 2Divus Alexander - 1Trebonianus Gallus (AD 251-3) - 129Volusian (Augustus) - 76Aemilian (AD 253) - 5Valerian & Gallienus (AD 253-60)Valerian - 256Gallienus - 416 (incl 1 fused)Salonina - 177Valerian II - 88Divus Valerian II - 54Saloninus Caesar - 94Saloninus Augustus - 1Diva Mariniana - 3Sole Reign of Gallienus (AD 260-8)Gallienus - 1Salonina - 2Gallic EmpirePostumus (AD 260-8) - 763 (incl 1 fused)Victorinus (AD 269-71) - 5[1]Irregular - 4Emperor illegible - 18 (mostly encrusted in organic material)Total 165 3170 4[1] 4 x mint I, PAX AVG (2 x series II, 1 x series III & 1 x series I-III); 1 x mint II, series I, with bust of MariusFrom the Same Find?The coins were lifted en masse and when treated in the conservation lab at the BM some were found to be fused together in rolls with remains of cloth and string preserved in the corrosion products; good physical evidence that they were buried together in antiquity. A large amount of potsherds from what had once been a sizable greyware vessel (locally made utilitarian pottery) was also discovered with the coin. With some traces of corrosion product - leaving some coin-shaped shadows - it was likely to have been the method of storage for the hoard.Metal content?Numismatically, this group of coins could all have circulated together in the third century AD. Coins issued prior to the reign of the emperor Septimius Severus (AD 193-211), whose major debasement of the silver coinage made earlier coin attractive to those wishing to remove them to take advantage of their higher silver content, are almost absent and this fits a known pattern for British hoards deposited as this time. The single coin present of Antoninus Pius (AD 138-61) would, on past scientific tests of similar specimens, be somewhere in the region of 80-90% silver. Those of Severus are less than half silver, necessitating the 'enrichment' of the surface by chemically leaching out the baser material from the blank prior to striking with the coin dies. Fineness subsequently drops throughout the century until issues of AD 270 contain only a few per cent - disguised by applied silver 'wash' to the surface.[1] 4 x mint I, PAX AVG (2 x series II, 1 x series III & 1 x series I-III); 1 x mint II, series I, with bust of Marius",

      "On the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard (a group of coins left behind from one deposit) and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces of base composition. The pot fragments should be considered likewise by virtue of their association with the coins.Treasure report byRichard AbdyBritish Museum",

      "Found with the aid of a metal detector, 2013. This debased radiate hoard was clearly quite scattered as it was found with late Roman bronzes of other periods. The material from Valerian to the Tetrici seems to form a discrete group, with the coins of Carausius also regarded as part of this hoard.The proportion of Victorinus to Tetricus in Normanby, a radiate hoard closing with the earlier coins of Carausius is 1:2.8. For Marlborough it is 1:2. Thus the current hoard seems to have an earlier composition than Normanby as well as the obviously large gap between AD 274 and AD 286. Nevertheless the Carausian coins present are all from the earliest part of the reign so they must remain plausible as hoard material and they are included in this catalogue for this reason as well as their numismatic interest.Note: an additional 16 stray fourth century nummi were reported with the hoard.Summary:Central empire\t\t\tQty.\t\tValerian, AD 253-60\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\tSalonina (joint reign)\t\t\t1\t\tGallienus, sole reign (AD 260-8)\t\t\t43\t\tSalonina (sole reign)\t\t\t4\t\tClaudius II\t\t\t47\t\tDivus Claudius\t\t\t9\t\tQuintillus\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\tGallic empire\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\tPostumus\t\t\t6\t\tVictorinus\t\t\t75\t\tTetricus I\t\t\t101\t\tTetricus II\t\t\t49\t\tUncertain Gallic emperor\t\t\t40\t\tIllegible radiates\t\t\t53\t\tIrregular radiates\t\t\t29\t\tBritish empire\t\t\tQty.\t\tCarausius (AD 286-93)\t\t\t\t\t\t6 (all unmintmarked; c.

      "This report will consider these coins and ceramics with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure act (1996): Namely, their age, precious metal content and whether the items can be said to come from the same find.Circumstances of FindFound by Messrs D. Philips and B. Plasom with the aid of a metal detector about 70cm below the field surface, 1.12.06. The initial discovery of the coins was made in and around the remains of their plough damaged pottery container. A small excavation was then made by the Herts. and Beds. FLO, Julian Watters. This excavation yielded more coins and pottery. Watters concluded that the coins had been deposited on the same spot as a Roman rubbish pit or midden; however, due to the fact that the find had already been removed prior to investigation a stratigraphical relationship could not be established.Description of the coinsThis group consists of 1,456 coins made in the fourth century AD. In fact all but 14 were produced in the AD 340s and 350s. Each coin, generally known today as a nummus, is predominantly copper-alloy with a tiny admixture of silver. The legends on the reverse of the nummi of AD 348-50 invariably read FEL(ix) TEMP(orum) REPARATIO which can be translated as 'happy times are here again' ('FTR' on summary). It was an optimistic hope prompted by the year 348 coinciding with the 1,100th anniversary of the traditional founding of Rome and the belief that it marked the beginning of a new age for the embattled empire. The plentiful earlier coinage of the century prior to AD 348 is largely absent here and this is generally the case with previously recorded 'Fel Temp' hoards.[1]Catalogue:London Amiens Trier Lyon Arles Others Uncert.

The first was produced during AD 348-50, the joint reign of Constantius II (AD 337-61) and his younger brother Constans (AD 337-50). Both had been brought up as Christians by their father Constantine the Great (AD 306-37) the first emperor to adopt the faith. Constans was the last legitimate emperor to visit Britain. The second consists of issues of the half-British usurper Magnentius who eliminated Constans and briefly made himself emperor of the west until defeated by the surviving brother. Shortly after Magnentius's downfall Constantius again reformed the coinage which had the effect of removing the usurper's coins from circulation. The assemblage just stretches into this third, post-Magnentian period. Although there are many reasons for the abandonment of hoards, it is possible that these coins quickly became useless or, worse still, represented an unwanted association with a discredited regime.From the same find?Chronologically the coins belong to one coinage system and form a discrete compositional group of coins that would have been briefly current in Britain around the middle of the fourth century AD.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being bronze coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces. The pottery fragments by their association with the coins should likewise be considered treasure.Richard AbdyDept. of Coins and MedalsBritish MuseumThe ceramicsAround 15 fragments of a squat coarseware storage jar with green copper alloy staining on the inner surface where the pot has been in direct contact with the coins. The fabric (pink grog tempered ware) is dull pink with a heavy grey core and ill sorted inclusions of grog and mica (Tomber and Dore 1998, 210).ConclusionThere are also a large number of fragments of other similar coarseware vessels in a range of fabrics, as well as tile, brick and fragments of mortaria. Only the pieces stained with copper can be directly associated with the coin hoard and considered as treasure.Ref.: Tomber, R. & Dore, J. 1998. The National Roman Fabric Reference collection.

From the similarity of composition to Prestwood A, it would be safe to assume that these two coins, being from the same findspot, are subsequent discoveries that were originally part of the same deposit and should be treated as addenda to this case.Metal ContentThe two coins from the current find are about 50-80% silver. The Treasure Act threshold for two or more coins from the same find is a minimum of 10% precious metal (ten or more coins of base composition also qualify).ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure, both on the grounds of being two or more precious metal coins from the same find, and on the grounds of their potential association with an earlier treasure case.Richard AbdyDept. of Coins and MedalsBritish Museum7th April 2005",

      "This small nummus hoard consists of coins made after the reform of 348. There is nothing of the plentiful coinage of the 320-48 - as is generally the case with other Fel Temp nummus hoards.[1] The Antonine dupondius / as and one modern coin (?18th century) should be treated as stray finds. Not connected to West Wycombe I (2005/T121), an Antonine period denarius hoard.DispositionAll the coins were corroded; many were fragmentary and most not fully legible.

      "29 silver denarii and 3 bronze coins were found in the parish of Cadeby, Leicestershire. The coins were found in an area which has many known Roman features including a road and settlement. The earliest coin dates from the first year of the reign of Vespasian (AD 69-70), while the latest are the three issues of Faustina II, wife of Marcus Aurelius. The hoard was probably deposited late in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.Hoard summary:Vespasian 3 -Reign of Titus (Domitian Caesar) 1 -Domitian 4 -Trajan 7 -Hadrian 5 -Sabina 1 -Aelius Caesar, under Hadrian 1 -Antoninus Pius 1 -Deified Faustina I 2 -Marcus Aurelius 1 -Faustina II 3 -Uncertain - 129 + 3CATALOGUE\t\t\tWEIGHT\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDATE\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBMC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQTY\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVESPASIAN, 69-79\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[IM]P CAESAR VESPASIANVS AVG;

      "Treasure case 2013 T73: Disclaimed and returned to finderCircumstances of Discovery: Found as a discrete group under a stone by [redacted] during a metal detector rally, 10.2.2013. Many other finders discovered Roman coins (and other artefacts) in the same field during the rally, but they seem to have been very mixed group of site coins probably representing an unrelated build-up of individual losses over centuries (from the 2nd to the end of the 4th centuries AD). These stray finds of Roman artefacts have been passed over to the Portable Antiquities Scheme for recording.Description of the coinsAll the coins that can be identified or part-identified (the coins were in poor and often fragmentary condition) appear to be Constantinian nummi (sing. nummus) (i.e. of the emperor Constantine the Great, AD 306-337, and his sons) of the period, c.AD 324-340. They were made in various mints from around the Roman Empire as follows:Summary: Trier Lyon Arles Others Uncertain Total AD 324-30 1 - - - - 1AD 330-35 15 2 5 1 62 85AD 335-40 1 - - - 13 14Uncertain reverses - - - - 37 37Irregular - - - - 1 1Total 17 2 5 1 113 138 From the same find?The identifiable coins cover a chronologically close period of a few decades, much like we would expect to find in our purses today.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being base metal coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces.",

      "A fused lump of Late Roman base metal coins. Please see the extract from the Treasure report (below) for further details.Report for H.M. CoronerThis report will consider these coins with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure act (1996): Namely, their age, precious metal content and whether the coins can be said to come from the same find.Description of the coinsThe hoard is a fused in a lump which has been squashed as if extruded through a narrow gap. Perhaps the result of concealment in a building which has subsequently burnt down. None of the uncertain number of coins can be identified but they are of the size of debased radiates or Constantinian nummi. Weight = 80.05g and max length = 75mm.DiscussionOn the balance of probabilities, this find is likely to consist of ten or more base metal coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years, and thus qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.Richard AbdyDept. of Coins and MedalsBritish Museum16.05.2013",

The finder initially found 2 pieces of twisted iron wire with 13 of the coins in a close concentration within a pasture field and, realising there were more coins in the group, he left them in the ground and called the local Finds Liaison Officer, Laura Burnett. On the 30th October 2012 Laura Burnett, PAS intern Alice Forward and Dr Richard Brunning of the Somerset Historic Environment Service went to the findspot and, with the landowners and a representative of the finder present excavated the remaining coins.DispositionThe findspot of the coins was on the edge of an known, but unscheduled, Roman, and possibly Late Iron Age site of 1st to 4th century date (Somerset HER ref 10947).  The pasture field was on the north side of the Polden ridge at a point where it is cut by the head of a small stream. The findspot was on a break in the slope before it angled down more steeply to the stream. A small 1m (E-W) by 1.5m (N-S) trench was opened up around the detectorist hole and excavated down through the top soil by hand (Fig 1). The soil was metal detected before and after removal to ensure no coins were missed.  The top soil was featureless with only 1 sherd of Bristol Treacle glazed tankard retrieved from it. The excavation came down on to a distict paler, more compact and stoneyer layer, possble a yard or floor although there was no flooring material. The remaining insitu coins rested on a distinct black organic patch c. 20cm by 15cm on top of this layer (Fig 2). They were at several different angles but in distinct rows or groups, possibly from being arranged in rows or falling that way naturally within a loose bag. The organic material was unstructured and was interpreted as possibly decayed leather rather than a more fiberous material such as wood. There was no pottery with the coins although a small group of 10 sherds of Black Burnished Ware was found about 15cm to the east. In the southern end of the trench possible footings for a wall were located the the trench extended a further meter to the south at half the width. It was not possible from a trench of this size to establish the nature of the structure. A plan of the trench can be consulted on request.Non-coin findsTwo twisted pieces of iron wire were found with the initial 13 coins. Each piece of wire is folded in half to create a loop and the two are joined with one looped through the other. One of the pieces of wire has been twisted three times after the loop at which point it is broken whereas the other piece of wire is broken just after the loop. It is possible that this is a fitting and was deposited with the coins.The pottery was not found directly associated with the coin hoard and appears to be a separate deposition. 10 sherds of Roman Black Burnished ware were excavated a little to the east of the coins and two sherds, 1 small, glazed post-medieval sherd and another sherd of Black Burnished ware, were found within the remains of the wall. The main group of 10 sherds were all undiagnostic body sherds and may or may not have come from one vessel. As the pottery does not appear to have been directly deposited with the coins in our opinion it does not constitue associated finds as defined under the Treasure Act (1996). A more detailed pottery report has been deposited with the HER.The CoinsThe coins are all of the denomination known as 'radiates', the latest being a barbarous radiate dating to c. AD 275 to 285. They mainly comprise coins of the Gallic Empire with coins of Tetricus I and II making up half of the total. The coins were rectrieved and numbered individually with certain groups lying together. Coins Excavated numbers 2-8, 13-16, 20-26 and 27-30 were in rows with one coin aligned with and touching the next with 9-12 in a slightly looser row and the remainder at angles to them. Looking at these as groups there does not appear to be a fixed pattern. 20-26 for example consists of six coins of Tetricus I and II with the central coin being one Claudius II. This suggests that the group was taken from a mixed source such as the general money supply.Summary by reign:Central empireGallienus (sole reign) (AD 260-8)                               8Claudius II (AD 268-70)                                            3Gallic EmpirePostumus (AD 260-9)                                                 2Victorinus (AD 269-71)                                              6Tetricus I (AD 271-4)                                                 11            Tetricus II                                                       11Contemporary copies                                                  1Illegible                                                                       2Total                                                                           44CATALOGUERADIATES (18)GALLIENUS Sole Reign (8)Rome (6)3rd  series (1): GALLIENVS AVGNo.ReverseBust m.-m.CunetioRICQty.PAX AVG(Pax stg. l. with branch and transverse sceptre)A1- T//-10432561[1]5th series (2): GALLIENVS AVGNo.ReverseBust m.-m.CunetioRICQty.FORTVNA REDVX(Fortuna stg. l. with rudder and corncucopia)A1- ?//-1215cf 1931[2]VBERITAS AVG(Uberitas stg. l. with purse and cornucopia)A1-?//-1200287var.1[3]6th series (2): GALLIENVS AVGNo.ReverseBust m.-m.CunetioRICQty.LIBERO P CONS AVG (Tigress l.)A1B13412301LIBERO P CONS AVG (Tigress l.)A1[B]13412301[4]6th series (1): [...GALLIENVS AVG]No.ReverseBust m.-m.CunetioRICQty.DIANAE CONS AVG (Stag l.)Z[X]Cf 13991791Uncertain mint (2)(2): GALLIENVS AVGNo.ReverseBust m.-m.CunetioRICQty.PAX AVG (Pax stg. l. with branch and transverse sceptre)A1-1009 or 1821256 or 5751[5]Illegible (female figure stg. l. with right hand raised)A1??-1[6]CLAUDIUS II (3)Rome (2)2nd series (1): IMP C CLAVDIVS AVGVIRTVS AVG (Virtus stg. l. holding branch and spear)B1- -//-6431091[7]2nd / 3rd series (1): IMP [C] CLAVDIVS AVGNo.ReverseBust m.-m.Nby.RICQty.VICTORIA AVG (Victory stg. l., holding wreath and palm)A1- -//-712104 / 51Uncertain mint (1)(1) Obv: IMP C[LAVDIVS] P F AVGNo.ReverseBust m.-m.Nby.RICQty.SPES AVG (Victory stg.

      "Treasure case 2012 T732: Acquired by the Museum of Somerset1 AR miliarensis, 60 AR siliquae to AD395, BM ref.: 2012 T732Description of the find:The current find consists of 1 fragment of a miliarensis, 39 complete or near complete silver siliquae (two broken into three fragments each), 20 incomplete silver siliquae (one made of two fragments), and one fragment, probably of a silver coin included with the siliquae. The fragmentary examples have been checked against the fragments in the original group and those in the addenda. Two fitted: coin 21d in this addenda with coin 26b in the original group and coin 33c with 49 in the original group. Therefore this new group represents 58 previously unrecorded siliquae bringing the total known to 130 siliquae, 1 miliarensis and 1 half-siliqua. As with the previous group there is evidence of recent as well as old damage with some fresh breaks.The addenda generally follow the pattern of the original group. The latest addenda coin, as in the original group, is dated AD 388-395 suggesting an end date before AD 395 is still probable for the hoard. This end date is relatively unusual for British siliqua hoards , which more commonly end with the period 395-402. Again, as with the original group, the lack of clipping also supports an early date. Trier is the main mint represented (39 out of 61 coins), 15 of the coins are of Magnus Maximus and 12 are of Gratian.The findspot and types of the coins suggest these finds are part of the same hoard as 2010 T278 and 2011 T233. In terms of age, association as a group and as the coins contains a minimum of 10% precious metal they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.Laura BurnettSomerset FLO",

      "Report to HM Coroner by Eleanor Ghey (Department of Coins and Medals, British Museum)Circumstances of discoverySilver coins were found on 20th September 2012, whilst searching with metal detectors. The coins were found in the same area as the earlier find 2011T654 of 65 silver denarii and are therefore considered to be addenda to this case.The number of coins found consisted of 17 whole coins and 16 fragments (33 pieces). Some of the breaks were old and some appeared more recent, suggesting that the hoard may have been hit and dispersed during ploughing. On examination at the British Museum, two separate pairs of fragments were found to fit together, reducing the total number of separate pieces to 31, of which 25 can be said to be individual coins within the group (some of which were incomplete) and 6 should be considered as fragments. One fragment was found to join an incomplete coin of Tiberius from the 2011 find, (bringing the total number of coins in the hoard so far to 88 and 7 fragments).The coinsThe coins are all Roman coins of the denomination known as the denarius (pl. denarii). The earliest coins date from the Roman Republican period (the earliest coin in this find can be dated to 140 BC). The Roman Imperial period is represented by denarii of Augustus and Tiberius, up to AD 37 (and within the date range of the first group, which contained coins of Claudius to AD 50-54). Some of the coins were too worn or fragmentary to be identified.Summary:Roman Republic (to 31 BC): 15 coinsAugustus (32 BC-AD 14): 2 coinsTiberius (AD 14-37): 7+2 fragmentsUnidentified: 1 coinUncertain fragments: 4 coinsTotal: 25+6 fragments.Metal Content and AgeThe coins satisfy the terms of the Treasure Act with regard to their age and metal content. They are certainly more than 300 years old and have a precious metal content far in excess of the 10% threshold.Same find?Roman Republican coins circulated for a long period in Britain due to their high silver content and the composition of the group is as expected for a deposit of mid first century AD date. The coins can therefore be considered as part of the same dispersed find, and as addenda to 2011T654.RecommendationOn the balance of probabilities, I conclude that this find constitutes a prima facie case of treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996), by being a group of two or more precious metal coins of the same find.",

      "Circumstances of Find These coins, together with the remains of a broken ceramic jar were found in September 2012 using a metal detector and subsequently reported to the Finds Liaison Officer for Salisbury and South Wiltshire.Description of FindThe coins date to between AD c. 286 and 317. This was the era of a collegiate system of imperial rule (usually 2-4 official rulers) set up by the great reforming emperor Diocletian (AD 284-305) known as tetrarchy (diarchy up to 293 and after 313). Most of the coins are a standard base metal denomination known as a nummus (pl. nummi) dating to the period AD 307-317, a time which came to be dominated by two personalities: Constantine the Great (AD 306-37) the first Christian emperor and his pagan rival Licinius (AD 308-24). However, three earlier denominations are also present representing a smaller fraction of the nummus and known as radiates (from the distinctive headgear of the emperor emanating the sun's rays as opposed to the busts on the nummi which are laureate).Summary:Radiates:Diocletian (AD 284-305) 1Maximianus (AD 285-305) 1Allectus (AD 293-6) 1Total 3Nummi (by date and mint):\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPeriod\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLondon \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrier\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLyon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTicinum\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRome\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOstia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSiscia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t307-313\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t585\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t408\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t78\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t19\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1104\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t313-317\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t94\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t32\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t25\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t155\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t680\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t441\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t103\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t21\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1263\t\t\t\t\t\tThese coins belong to a short-lived coinage system (which was subsequently reformed in AD 317, driving earlier coins out of circulation) and form a discrete compositional group.

In addition twenty sherds (together with some minor fragments) of Roman pottery also recovered had probably formed their container - the inside of the pot had built up greenish deposits consistent with prolonged contact with the copper alloy coins.Metal ContentAll the coins are an argentiferous copper-alloy.

      "Description of findThe coins consist of 3 silver Roman coins of the denomination known as a denarius (plural denarii). In addition there were two fragments of denarii that were not identifiable due to their size and condition but do not appear to have come from the three more complete coins. It should be noted that the original find contained a number of fragments of coins, but it is unlikely to be possible to find joins between these and the latest fragments due to their condition. The three identifiable coins consist of two coins from the reign of Vespasian and one from the reign of Hadrian, situating them well within the date range of the earlier find (c. 32BC to AD 176).Metal Content and AgeThe coins satisfy the terms of the Treasure Act with regard to age and metal content. They are certainly more than 300 years old and have a precious metal contents in excess of 10%.Same find?The composition of the group as a whole is typical for a hoard deposited in the mid to late second century AD.RecommendationOn the balance of probabilities, I conclude that this hoard of denarii constitutes a prima facie case of treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996), by being part of a group of two or more precious metal coins of the same find and should be considered as addenda to 2012 T132.Report by Dr Eleanor Ghey (Department of Coins and Medals, British Museum)",

      "Treasure case 2012 T572, disclaimed returned to finder.Circumstances of discoveryThis small mid-Constantinian nummus hoard was found by Mr David Lee with the aid of a metal detector, between 21.2.12 and 25.07.2012. The coins were reported to have been at a depth of up to six inches and within an area of four square yards in a ploughed field.DispositionThe coins were reported by the finder as being found scatted through the plough soil with no obvious concentration. The finder also stated that he has not found any other roman coins in the field and therefore the concentration was discreet. They are in very poor condition and many were fused together, no images of the coins in the ground were made.Summary\t\t\tTrier\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLyon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRome\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAquileia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSiscia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEastern\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRadiates\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 330-5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAD 335-40\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain reverses\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t25\t\t\t\t\tCATALOGUENote.

      "Treasure case 2011 T233: Acquired by the Museum of SomersetCircumstances of discovery Addenda to the 2010 find of a hoard of 61 siliqua and 1 half siliqua (2010 T278, SOM-6E89B0) was found on 1st March 2011 whilst metal-detecting on recently cultivated pasture.It was found in the same area as the original case. The coins were dispersed in an area of topsoil about 40 metres square, at the entrance to the field.Description of the find The current find consists of 11 silver siliquae, a number of which were fragmentary. The fragmentary examples have been checked against the fragments in the original group and none are from the same siliqua. As with the previous group there is evidence of recent as well as old damage with some fresh abrasions.The addenda generally follows the pattern of the original group although there are none of the earlier types that were represented in the original group (AD 355 -367). The latest addenda coin, as in the original group, is dated AD 388-395 suggesting an end date before AD 395 is still probable for the hoard. This end date is relatively unusual for British siliqua hoards (Bland, Moorhead and Walton forthcoming, 'Finds of late Roman silver coins from Britain: the contribution of the Portable Antiquities Scheme). Again, as with the original group, only one of the siliqua is clipped and one possible clipped supporting an early date. Trier is the main mint represented (10 out of 11 coins) and six out of the coins are of Gratian.The findspot and types of the coins suggest these finds are part of the same hoard as 2010 T278. In terms of age, association as a group and as the coins contains a minimum of 10% precious metal they qualify as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.A full catalogue is available on request.",

      "A silver coin hoard of Roman denarii, found during archaeological excavations of the route of the East Kent Access Road by Oxford Wessex Archaeology in 2010. Comprises of five coins, ranging in date from a very worn issue of Vespasian (Object 2730, AD 69 - 79) through to one of Antoninus Pius (Object 2723, minted AD 155 - 156). Two of these coins, Objects 2722, a denarius of Marcus Aurelius as Caesar minted in AD 146 to 147 and a denarius of Nerva, minted in AD 97 were corroded together. The fifth coin, (Object 2724) was minted by the emperor Trajan, in AD 101-2. There can be little doubt that these form a small hoard, collected and deposited in the second half of the 2nd century AD, probably shortly after the latest coin was minted in AD 155 - 156. Although the degree of wear on a coin is not an infallible indication of the time it spent in circulation, the heavy wear recorded on the issue of Vespasian is consistent with the suggested deposition date. With the exception of this coin, the coins showed relatively little evidence of wear, although traces of post-depositional corrosion were recorded.Object\t\t\tType\t\t\tIssuer/Type\t\t\tDate\t\t\tReference\t\t2730\t\t\tAR denarius\t\t\tVespasian - uncertain\t\t\tAD 69 - 79\t\t\t-\t\t2739\t\t\tAR denarius\t\t\tFORTVNA AVGVST type\t\t\tAD 97\t\t\tRIC II, Nerva, 16\t\t2724\t\t\tAR Denarius\t\t\tTrajan - Hercules PM TRP COS IIII PP type\t\t\tAD 101-102\t\t\tRIC II, Trajan, 49\t\t2722\t\t\tAR Denarius\t\t\tMarcus Aurelius- Spes 1 TR POT COS II type\t\t\tAD 146-147\t\t\tRIC III, Antoninus Pius\t\t2723\t\t\tAR Denarius\t\t\tAntoninus Pius - Salus 1 TR POT XIX COS IIIII type\t\t\tAD 155-156\t\t\tRIC III, Antoninus Pius\t\tObject Numbers 2722, 2723, 2724, 2730, 2739 Photos EKAR_silver_coin_ON2722; EKAR_silver_coin_ON2723; EKAR_silver_coin_ON2724; EKAR_silver_coin_ON2730; EKAR_silver_coin_ON2739 Date: Roman, AD69-156 Diameters: 18-20mmLorraine Mepham, Wessex Archaeology",

The coins were spread over a considerable distance (c. 80 metres square) and found piecemeal over a period of about 6 months. Several of the coins are broken, probably as a result of modern cultivation.

This is very corroded and so its condition when deposited cannot ascertained. The hoard is certainly very late in date for an aes hoard and could well be connected to the recycling of sestertii and the sub-denominations at a time when these coins were worth more as scrap metal than as units within an ordered monetary system. If this was the case then the hoard was quite possibly connected to irregular radiate production in the 270s although the only possible evidence for this in the immediate area was a small piece of copper alloy bar similar in general form to other such bars recovered from irregular third-century mint sites. Large bronzes of the third century are distinctly uncommon in Britain and their scarcity in a hoard like this is not unusual. Whether it was a currency hoard or a scrap hoard this group of coins was most likely lost or deposited at some time within the third quarter of the third century.Discussion: A group of ten or more base metal coins lost or deposited in the ground together more than 300 years ago constitutes a case of Treasure. This group fulfils these criteria and thus represents a case of Treasure.",

It appears to be an example of the earlier issue of Aquileia although the exergue mintmark is not really legible. The possibility remains of it being an issue of Rome from the next period; and thus the sole example in the hoard of a coin of AD 395-402. (Note: RIC X considers the possibility of the Aquileia type continuing for a very short while beyond AD 395) The hoard certainly runs up to AD 393-5 since it contains one coin of Honorius (mint of Lyon) prior to the death of Theodosius I.Disposition?? images taken by PAS.Summary:Mint Trier Lyon Rome Aquileia Eastern Uncert. totalGallienus (sole reign, AD 260-8) - - 1 - - - 1Claudius II (AD 268-70) - - 3 - - - 3Irregular radiate - - - - - 1 1Later Constantinian, AD 337-40 1 - - - 1 1 3Fel Temp, AD 348-50 - - - - - 1 1Post-Magnentian, AD 354-61 - - - - 1 4 5Valentinianic, AD 364-83 - 1 - - 1 1 3Theodosian, AD 383-95 - 1 - 1 1 - 3Uncertain nummi - - - - - 7 7Total 1 2 4 1 4 15 27CATALOGUENote.

      "The find contained 1062 copper alloy coins of the denomination known as radiates, (originally a silver multiple of the denarius, but gradually becoming debased to the eventual point of being essentially bronze (c.1% silver)). The coins found range in date from the AD 250s to AD 283. The coins were of variable condition, with some of the excavation coins in particular being fragmentary and worn. It seems likely that the coins retrieved by excavation were part of the same hoard (these ranged from Gallienus to Probus).

The thickness and shallow curvature of the larger fragments indicates that they are from a large, wide vessel with thick walls.Seven small irregular fragments of copper alloy sheet were also found. The largest fragment has traces of a white metal adhering to one surface.These are probably Iron Age or Roman in date.Excavation objects:Cu alloy vessel:Three large and 15 small fragments of a thin-walled cu alloy vessel. The largest fragment is from the base of the vessel with a shallow portion of the wall still attached in places. This fragment measures a maximum of 120.5mm x 99.0mm in diameter. It is flat and the remainder of one edge indicates a circular shape, 0.9mm think and weighing 32.0g. Two other large fragments derive from the walls of the vessel and are gently curved. They measure a maximum of 84.7mm x 41.0mm and 77.7mm x 30.5mm and weigh 9.0g and 6.5g respectively. Both are 0.9mm thick.From the curvature of the edge of the base, it is estimated that the base would have been approximately 12cm in diameter. The curvature of the wall fragments suggests maximum diameter of approximately 15cm for the bowl, tapering inwards slightly towards the rim.The fragments are all undecorated though one tiny fragment (SF 14) may have been coated with a silver metalThe vessel is likely to be Iron Age or Roman in dateSlag:Nine lumps of iron slag and one of an unknown metal. The largest measures 79.7mm x 67.7mm x 40.7mm and weighs 293.6g.Their date is unknown though likely to be Iron Age or Roman if associated with the hoard.Button:A button with a pronounced convex upper surface and a central pimple, and a slightly convex lower surface. Two small circular depressions on the underside mark the position of the now missing attachment loop. The button measures 12.3mm in diameter, 6.7mm in height and weighs 3.6g. It is probably 17th-18th century in date. Analysis has confirmed that the button is made of a tin-rich alloy of copper and has significantly less that 10% silver and this item therefore falls outside the provisions of the Treasure Act 1996 as it is not associated with the other items found.",

      "Silver coins were found on 19th February 2012. Possible structural remains in the area were subsequently investigated by T. Brindle and S. Dean. These are thought to consist of part of a collapsed boundary wall. Further coins and fragments were subsequently recovered during site survey in April and are included in this report.The coins consisted of at least 258 silver Roman coins of the denomination known as a denarius (plural denarii). It was difficult to estimate precisely the total number of coins in the hoard due to the degree of fragmentation (an attempt was made to match joining fragments where possible and these are now counted as one coin). The earliest coin was a denarius of Mark Antony dated to c. 32-31BC) and the latest coin was a denarius of Faustina II (traditionally dated to c. AD 161-176) from the reign of Marcus Aurelius (AD 161-180).Summary of coins by emperor Republic (Mark Antony) 1Nero (AD 54-68) 2Galba (AD 68-69) 1Vitellius (AD 69) 3Vespasian (AD 69-79) 18Titus 4Domitian 3Titus (AD 79-81) 2Divus Vespasian 1Domitian 3Domitian (AD 81-96) 14Uncertain Flavian emperor 4Nerva (AD 96-98) 4Trajan (AD 98-117) 67Hadrian (AD 117-38) 55Sabina 3Antoninus Pius (AD 138-61) 30Faustina I 11Faustina II 4Marcus Aurelius Caesar 4Marcus Aurelius (AD 161-180)Divus Antoninus 3Faustina II 1Marcus Aurelius 1LuciusVerus 2Lucilla 1Uncertain emperor 16Total 258 coins + smaller fragments Roman Republican coins of Mark Antony are known to have circulated for a long period in Britain, and certainly during the second century AD.

Some burnt wood and a pottery fragment was found at the same time.The coinsAlthough this hoard has a small 'tail' of third century types down to Postumus, other hoards and D. R. Walker's analysis of the Bath assemblage demonstrate the reliance on the continuing circulation of the increasingly worn coins of the previous century. Thus the large group of illegible coins were probably mainly composed of earlier types that had become much worn. Identification was also hampered by corrosion and the fragmentary nature of the illegibles make their identification as sestertii (as opposed to lower denominations) somewhat subjective in some cases.Summary of hoard:Hadrian (AD 117-38) 1Marcus Aurelius (AD 161-180) 1Lucius Verus (AD 161-9) 2Diva Faustina II 1Wars of the Succession (AD 193-7):Septimius Severus 1Severus Alexander (AD 222-235) 1Maximianus I (AD 235-8) 1Decius (AD 249-51) 1Postumus (AD 260-9) 2Illegible 23Total 34",

      "214 Roman coins were found on 24th November 2011. They were buried up to a depth of 18 inches, some being found scattered on the surface, over an area of about 20 square yards. The find was reported to Dr. A. Popescu at the Fitzwilliam Museum before being brought to the British Museum for identification in December 2011.The coins were all copper alloy and of the denomination known today as a nummus, mostly of larger size and post-dating AD 348. The latest coins in the hoard were a small number of Fallen Horseman types of Constantius II and Gallus, the former dated to AD 355. The largest proportion of the hoard is made up of coins from the reign of the usurper Magnentius, with a very few final coins dating from the period of the restoration of Constantius II.M Magnentius D

      "Circumstances: Found while searching with a metal detector between September 2009 and March 2010. The coins were found in a close area, this area had previously yielded six denarii of similar date, undoubtedly part of the same hoard (2009 T295).Description: Eleven Roman silver denarii. The earliest are two worn specimens of the second half of the first century, the others of later date, mainly belonging to the Severan dynasty. With the six earlier coins they form a discrete group in terms of date and denomination and there seems no doubt that they represent part of a dispersed hoard. The latest coin so far recovered from this area (reported under Treasure number 2009 T295) dated to 213-7, a date in accord with this group, and suggests a date of deposition in the third or fourth decade of the third century.CatalogueVitellius, RIC I, 105, 69 Vespasian, RIC II, 10, 69-71 Diva Faustina I, RIC III, 351, 141 Commodus, RIC III, 187, 189Clodius Albinus, RIC IV.1, 7, 194-5 Julia Domna, RIC IV.1, 564, 196-211Julia Domna, RIC IV.1, 572, 196-211 Julia Domna, RIC IV.1, 580, 196-211Julia Domna, RIC IV.1, 587, 196-211 Septimius Severus, RIC IV.1, 167a, 200-1Septimius Severus, RIC IV.1, 234, 210  Date: Latest coin 210 AD.Discussion: These coins are all of silver and over three hundred years in age. It seems most likely that they were deposited or lost together and thus they represent, a priori, under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996, a case of Treasure.Author: Adrian B.

      "16 silver denarii.Report done by Richard Abdy, Curator fro roman Coins at the British Museum:The coins are Roman silver coins of a denomination known as the denarius (plural denarii). The earliest was from the time of Vespasian (AD 69-79). The latest coin is of Diva Faustina I (deified after her death) which could have been produced up to the end of the reign of her husband Antoninus Pius in AD 161. The coins can be summarised as follows:Vespasian (AD 69-79) 1Titus Caesar 2Domitian (AD 81-96) 2Nerva (AD 96-8) 2Trajan (AD 98-117) 6Hadrian (AD 119-38) 2Antoninus Pius (AD 138-61) -Diva Faustina I 1Date and Metal ContentThe coins satisfy the terms of the Treasure Act with regard to age and metal content. They are certainly more than 300 years old and all have precious metal contents far in excess of the 10% threshold.Of the same find?It is unlikely that sixteen ancient precious metal coins could have come from the same findspot as a result of accidental individual deposition. This together with the close chronological grouping therefore suggests that these coins formed a hoard, by being buried together in the second century AD.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, I conclude that this find constitutes a prima facie case of treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996), by being a group of two or more precious metal coins of the same find.NOTE: in 2013/4 two additional denarii were found and have been recorded as part of this hoard.

      "A group of 3,874 Roman radiates within a Severn Valley Ware narrow mouthed storage jar dating from the Emperor Philip II to the Emperor Probus (244-282 AD).The coins range in date from AD 244-282 (the coins of the emperor Probus include his final issues from Lyon which carry the letters A-D marking the four workshops of the mint). The group is broadly similar in composition to the many Romano-British coin hoards (at over 200 so far recorded) buried in the aftermath of the breakaway 'Gallic Empire'. The Gallic empire, whose capital was at the city of Trier but which had held dominion over Britain, was established in AD 260 and reconquered by the legitimate ('central') emperor Aurelian in AD 274.One of the coins is a large (comparable in size to a modern �2 coin) brass sestertius of the second century AD. The rest of the coins are much smaller (between the size of a 1p and 20p piece) and are all of the denomination known as radiates, originally a silver multiple of the denarius, but by this time had become debased to the point of being essentially bronze (c.1% silver).Summary:Central empireHadrian, AD 117-38 1 (sestertius)Philip II Caesar, AD 244-7 1Valerian and Gallienus AD 253-60Valerian I 2Gallienus 2Salonina 10Saloninus Caesar 2Valerian II (Divus) 3Gallienus, AD 253-68 437Salonina 40Claudius II, AD 268-70 338Divus Claudius II 73Quintillus, AD 270 30Aurelian, AD 270-5 21Tacitus, AD 275-6 15Florian, AD 276 3Probus, AD 276-82 36Gallic empirePostumus, AD 260-9 61Laelian (AD 269) 7Marius (AD 269) 11Victorinus (AD 269-71) 811Divus Victorinus 3Tetricus I (AD 271-4) 1230Tetricus II 573Uncertain Gallic emperor 85Irregular 78Illegible 2Total 3875Summary of mintsCentral EmpireRome 806Gaul 42Milan 91Ticinum 11Siscia 27Antioch 4Uncertain/Other 33Total 1014Gallic EmpireMint I 1816Mint II 640Milan 8Uncertain 317Total 2781Uncertain Emperor 2Irregular 78Pottery- by C Jane Evans It was possible to estimate the original profile and thus the form and date of the jar containing the hoard, although the jar was in fragments and had not been washed. It will need to be reconstructed for illustration (ie publication), and fully quantified as part of the excavated pottery assemblage from the find site. The narrow-mouthed jar is in Severn Valley ware, WHEAS Fabric 12 (Hurst and Rees 1992; www.worcestershireceramics.org), the most common fabric produced and used in the region during the Roman period. This particular form, with a simple out-curving rim and globular profile, is thought to be a long lived type, dating from the mid first century AD to the fourth century AD (Webster 1976, fig. 1.1). It was the most common narrow mouthed jar type produced at the Malvern, Newland Hopfields kiln site (Evans et al 2000, fig. 21.JNM1), where the main period of production was dated to the mid-to-late second century into the third (op. cit. 70). The most interesting parallel, in terms of dating and perhaps the wider context of deposition, comes from excavations at Bays Meadow villa in Droitwich (Barfield 2006). The complete profile of a similar jar is published from Phase 3 (op. cit. fig. 97.116). This phase has a clear terminus post quem of c AD 289, based on coins associated with the construction of a defensive rampart (op. cit. 125-6). It is thought that the main villa was destroyed some time in the late 3rd century, and new building occurred from c AD 355. No good parallels for the jar are evident in the later 4th century, phase 4, assemblage from the site. Based on the evidence above, the form of the jar associated with the Bredon Hill hoard is entirely consistent with the date of the coins it contains. It is therefore likely to be broadly contemporary with the coins rather than being a reused older vessel.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being bronze coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces.",

      "Roman coin hoard found in a pottery vessel during an archaeological investigation. The hoard consists of 1,247 copper-alloy coins, the earliest dating to the middle of the 3rd century and the latest to c. AD 271.1,247 Roman coins in a pottery flask, and a second associated flask, from COLCHESTER, ESSEXThis report will consider the coins with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure Act (1996): i.e. their age, precious metal content, and whether they can be said to come from the same find. The latter point is clear from their archaeological context.The coins were packed into a grey ware flask (CAM 281) and then buried. An empty flask of the same form as that containing the coins had been buried upright and intact close by. It may have held a recovered hoard, or been buried as a reserve container for additional coins. This therefore originally was, or could have developed into, a two-container hoard.The coins range in date from AD 251/3-271. In composition the hoard is similar to many Romano-British coin hoards dating to the period of the breakaway Gallic Empire. This was founded in AD 260 by Postumus, governor of the two provinces of Germania, and covered Germany, Gaul, Spain and Britain. Its capital was Trier. In AD 274 the provinces were re-incorporated into the legitimate ('central') empire by Aurelian.Summary by reignCentral Empire        Trebonianus Gallus (251-3)            1        Valerian I, Gallienus and family (253-60)            117        Gallienus and Salonina (260-8)            81        undated coins of Gallienus and Salonina (253-68)            9        Claudius II (268-70)            10        Quintillus (270)            4        TOTAL            222        Gallic Empire        Postumus            557        Laelian            7        Marius            14        Victorinus            278        TOTAL            856        Identification uncertain or illegible            169        TOTAL                        1247                    The coins are all of the denomination known as radiate antoniniani, originally a silver multiple of the denarius but by this time debased to the point of being copper-alloy with a wash of silver on the surface (c. 1% silver). Traces of the silver wash still survive on several coins.Over 200 coin hoards with closing dates between 260 and 274 have been found in Britain, several very much larger than this one. Locally, one was found on Mersea Island in about 1980 and three were found in close association at, Gosbecks. None of these hoards was from an archaeological excavation and none was given to Colchester Museum.There can be no doubt but that these coins belong together as a hoard and that they constitute a prima facie case of treasure, being bronze coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and a coin find of more than ten pieces. Their pottery container and the second associated pottery flask should also be considered treasure by their association with the coins. As the developer has waived his right to the reward the find will go to Colchester Museum with the rest of the site archive (artefacts, ecofacts and site records).",

There is also a large group of unidentified base metal coins, probably from the same general period.Most of the denarii share the same orange corrosion, probably from being in an iron-rich context. This is also shared by many of the base metal coins. The chronological spread of the coins is also suggestive that the coins might have come from a hoard that has been dispersed. Furthermore, the lack of any radiates or nummi would make this a very unusual group.",

Both are in good condition with little trace of wear and were likely lost fairly soon after issue. Date: Late 380s or 390sDiscussion: Siliquae are rare as stray finds and are often found heavily clipped. These two are unclipped or nearly so and were also found within a few metres of one another.

      "Twenty Roman coins found in Brading parish in an area of about 25.0m in diameter. Treasure case no. 2011 T181. The coins were found on different occasions between 2003 and 2010. The finder stated that his brother also found a few during this period, but he has been unable to find them.This modest purse-full of bronzes runs up to at least the Antonine period. However the deposition date could be much later given the very worn condition of the coins and the lack of supply of post-Antonine bronzes to Roman Britain. The wear and corrosion precludes full identification beyond the emperor for most of the coins.

      "BRADING, ISLE OF WIGHTRichard Abdy & Frank Basford20 AE to AD 192 BM ref.: 2011 T181PAS ref: IOW-CBEB57Circumstances of DiscoveryThese 20 coins were found in an area of about 25.0m in diameter. The site is situated on the chalk downs several hundred metres northwest of Brading Roman Villa in Brading parish. They were found on different occasions between 2003 and 2010. The finder, Mr Tom Winch, stated that his brother, Mr Bill Winch, also found a few during this period, but he has been unable to find them.The CoinsThis modest purse-full of bronzes runs up to at least the Antonine period. However the deposition date could be much later given the very worn condition of the coins and the lack of supply of post-Antonine bronzes to Roman Britain. The wear and corrosion precludes full identification beyond the emperor for most of the coins. Two coins were probably Antonine period sestertii (sest); the rest appear to be lower denominations, dupondii or asses (dp/as). There is one Antoninus Pius Britannia as of AD 154-5, a familiar type in such hoards as a coin of British association apparently deliberately supplied to the province.DispositionIOW Heritage Service has expressed an interest in acquisition.

      "BRIGHSTONE, ISLE OF WIGHTRichard Abdy696+ BI radiates and pottery fragments to AD 274 BM ref.: 2011 T74Circumstances of discovery and report on pottery by Frank Basford (FLO: IOW)A Roman hoard of radiates was discovered within a ceramic vessel in the eroding cliff-face of the south-west coast of the Isle of Wight by Mr Mick Green. The side of the vessel, a New Forest Ware flagon (Fulford Type 1 (1975), was exposed, the colour coating had worn off and Mr Green thought it was bone. On prising it out of the cliff the vessel disintegrated into several pieces and the coins fell out. The majority of the coins were fused together and some became loose. The neck of the vessel was missing and a body sherd from the lower part of a Dorset Black-Burnished ware (BB1) cooking-pot of uncertain type, had been placed over the top to form a lid. The coins were taken home by Mr Green who used tap water to remove soil and then dried out on a table for a few days. Frank Basford (Isle of Wight FLO) was informed and visited the site with Mr Green. The vessel had been situated just beneath the topsoil within Brickearth about 30.0 cm from the surface. The find-spot was photographed and its position recorded using a hand-held GPS device. The vessel appears to have been fractured before it was removed as some of the breaks are old. Four small sherds of Vectis Ware pottery were found in the cliff-face about 30.0cm west of the coins.First and last coinsTwo specimens of Gallienus were noted from the joint reign AD 253-60) from the mints of Gaul (i.e. probably Trier) and Antioch. The latest coins are of the Tetrici, running up to the end of the reign (AD 274); although there are some coins of Aurelian (AD 270-5) present, these are all from Milan in the early part of the reign.DispostionThe finder has waived his portion of the reward in order to allow the hoard to be acquired by Brading Roman Villa.One coin was not represented in the BM collection. This was of Aurelian from the mint of Milan with the type of Concordia seated left and holding two standards (RIC 106)Summary:CENTRAL EMPIRE Rome Milan Others Uncertain TotalGallienus (joint reign, AD 253-60) - - 2 - 2Gallienus (sole reign, AD 260-8) 55 2 3 10 70Claudius II (AD 268-70) 46 10 4 13 73Divus Claudius 1 - - 1 2Quintillus (AD 270) 2 - - 1 3Aurelian (AD 270-5) - 4 - - 4Total 104 16 9 25 154GALLIC EMPIRE Mint I Mint II Milan U�nc�er�tain TotalPostumus (AD 260-9) 26 - 2 - 28Laelian (AD 269) - 2 - - 2Marius (AD 269) 2 - - - 2Victorinus (AD 269-71) 124 65 - 24 213Tetricus I (AD 271-4) 93 59 - 13 165Tetricus II 34 2 - 5 41Uncertain Gallic (AD 269-74) - - - 46 46Total 279 128 2 88 497Uncertain emperor - - - 40+ 40+Irregular - - - 5 5CATALOGUECENTRAL EMPIRE (154)GALLIENUS (joint reign) (2)Gaul (1)5th series: [GALLIE]NV[S?P?F?AVG][1] Conservation carried out at British Museum by Hayley BullockNo. Reverse Bust Cunetio Stge Qty.1.

      "This report will consider these coins with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure act (1996): Namely, their age, precious metal content and whether the coins can be said to come from the same find.Description of the coinsThe majority (16) of the coins are of a denomination commonly known as the nummus, produced from the reign of Constantine I (AD 306-337) and that of his sons; the earliest of these is thought to date to the period AD 318-330 but it is very worn and cannot be identified with certainty. The latest eight coins were issued under the house of Valentinian (AD 364-378). One of the coins is of an earlier denomination known as a 'radiate', and is likely to have been in circulation since the later part of the third century AD. It could be a stray find, but it is equally likely that it was still in circulation at the time of the deposition of the group, due to its similar size.Summary by mint / period (with reverse type)\t\t\tArles\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRome\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSiscia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThessalonica\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNicomedia\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUncertain\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRadiate AD 268-270\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEarly nummus AD 318-330\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGloria Exercitus (2) etc. AD 330-5\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTwo Victories etc AD 341-347\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFel Temp Reparatio AD 348-350\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPost Magnentian AD 354-361\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tValentinianic AD 364-378\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotal\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t17\t\t\t\t\tFrom the same find?The composition of this group of coins is typical of what one might expect to have been circulating in Britain towards the middle of the fourth century AD.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being bronze coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of ten or more pieces.Dr. Eleanor GheyCatalogueThe following abbreviations are used for the obverses:Cs Constantius II Cn ConstansV I Valentinian I Vn Valens G GratianRADIATE (1)Claudius II (1)\t\t\tNo.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tObverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReverse\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBust\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tQty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIMP C CLAVDIVS [AVG]\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIllegible\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZ\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t\t\t\t\tNUMMI (16)c.

      "Brief description of Knockin HoardThe hoard consists of twenty two Roman coins. They were found over a small area and probably represent a hoard that has been dispersed by ploughing. I have been informed that there were no associated finds (such as pottery or other metalwork) which would suggest that they were deposited in an organic (wood or leather) container that has since decayed. The find-spot of the hoard is close to the modern A5 which follows the route of a known Roman road. The condition of the coins is variable; several have been broken (probably through agricultural processes - such as ploughing). Others are slightly corroded, light green corrosion deposits can be seen on several of the coins. However, many of the coins have a heavy patina that covers all surfaces. All the coins seem to date from the first half of the fourth century AD (300 - c350), probably from the House of Constantine. This opinion is based on cursory study of the obverse (heads) and reverse (tails) types. These are only initial observations and a further in-depth report will be written by the curators at the British Museum in due course. This further report will confirm whether this hoard of coins is 'Treasure' in terms of the criteria laid out in the Treasure Act 1996.Peter Reavill FLO Shropshire and Herefordshire 14th January 2005British Museum report - 200522 BI nummi to ad 329 BM ref.: 2005/T71Circumstances of discoveryThis small Constantinian nummus hoard was found by XXXXXX with the aid of a metal detector, 21st December 2004.SummaryLondon Trier Lyon Siscia Others Uncertain Total Early-Constantinian - 2 1 1 - B 4Beat(a) Tranquillitas etc 7 1 - B - B 8Sarmatia, Vot X/XX etc 1 3 - 3 - - 7Providentiae - 1 - - - 1 2Irregular B B B B B 1 1Total 8 7 1 4 - 2  22 Dispositionreturned to finder after being disclaimed as treasureNo photographic record at the British Museum.CATALOGUENotesThe following abbreviations are used for the obverses:C I Constantine I Cr CrispusC II Constantine II Cs Constantius IIEARLY NUMMI (4)Trier (2)No. Obv.

      "CHETWYND ASTON AND WOODCOTE, SHROPSHIRE (2005 T70) Richard Abdy 40 AR/BI radiates to ad 274 Circumstances of Discovery Found with the aid of a metal detector, 14th November 2004. Find was made at a depth of 3-4\" and in a straight line of about 25 yards. Discussion A small radiate hoard, it is slightly earlier than the most typical British debased radiate hoards with only one identifiable radiate of Tetricus and a good number of the earlier, more silvery coins of Postumus and the pre-260 Central Empire. The collapse in the silver content of the Gallic coinage - AD 268 - had seemingly yet to take its full effect at the time of abandonment (unless careful selection was made by the hoarder) and the very debased coins of Gallienus's sole reign and Claudius II had made little inroad. It should be noted that the high proportion of corroded illegible coins could distort this picture - they appear very base and it may have been the case that the fully debased coins present reacted more during burial than the more silvery coins. For a discussion on the highly variable content of radiate hoards ending around the time of the death of Victorinus see E. Besly on the Bassaleg (Gwent) hoard (one denarius and 904 radiates to AD 270) in CHRB IX, pp. 87-100; C. Cheesman on The Radiate Hoards in CHRB X, pp. 171-9; see also R. Abdy on the 'M1' hoard (207 denarii and 228 radiates to AD 270) in CHRB XII (forthcoming).

      "7 AR siliquae and 143 base metal coins to AD 402 scattered over a relatively small area. The earliest coin is a nummus of Constantine I (330-5) and latest coins siliquae and nummi of the house of Theodosius struck no later than the early years of the fifth century. They form a compact group which would reflect the circulating medium in the last years of Roman Britain and is most likely the remains of a dispersed coin hoard. One of the coins was a radiate and it is possible associated with this hoard. The 25 addenda coins found July 2010 are marked with *DateThe hoard was most likely lost or deposited in the last years of Roman authority in Britain - a date in the very last years of the fourth century or the first decade of the fifth would seem most likely.ConclusionThese coins were clearly deposited or lost together and thus, as a hoard of bronze and silver coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years old, represent a case of Treasure.CATALOGUENote: Silver coins have clipping factor after weight.

      "2010 T547 Carisbrooke, Isle of WightREPORT TO H M CORONERCircumstances of DiscoveryA group of 24 copper alloy coins were found on 29th August 2010 by thirteen members of the Isle of Wight metal-detecting club. The find was reported to the Finds Liaison Officer, Frank Basford, who recorded the coins for the PAS. The coins were found whilst metal-detecting on cultivated land in the same area as a previous find of 28 copper alloy Roman coins (2008 T558).The coinsThe coins consist of a mixture of copper alloy denominations known as dupondii, asses and sestertii and are mostly worn in appearance. The latest identifiable coin of the hoard is a sestertius of Commodus dated to c. AD 183-184. The group of coins can be summarised as follows:Uncertain Nero or Vespasian (AD 54-79)        1Domitian (AD 81-96)                                       1Hadrian (AD 117-38)                                       2Sabina                                                 1Uncertain Hadrian or Antoninus Pius                 1Antoninus Pius (AD 138-61)                            8Faustina II                                            1Uncertain Antonine emperor                             1Commodus (AD 180-192)                               1Illegible                                                 7Total                                                               24Metal Content and AgeThe coins satisfy the terms of the Treasure Act with regard to age and quantity, being base metal coins over than 300 years old of a quantity over ten.Of the same find?This pattern fits well with that which might be expected for a hoard of Roman coins of copper alloy denominations deposited late in the second century AD. The composition of the group is similar to that of the group found in the same place in 2008.RecommendationI conclude that the coins above constitute a prima facie case of treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).Dr. Eleanor GheyThe Department of Coins and MedalsThe British  Museum28 October 2010CARISBROOKE, ISLE OF WIGHTEleanor Ghey[1]24 AE to c. AD 184BM ref.: 2010 T547Circumstances of discoveryFound whilst using a metal-detector on cultivated land by several members of the Isle of Wight Metal Detecting Club on the 29th August 2010.The coins were found in the same area as the previous find of 28 copper alloy coins 2008 T558.NoteThis hoard is in generally very poor condition with most of the coins unidentifiable. The latest identifiable coin is a sestertius of Commodus, probably dated to AD 183-4. In the earlier find of 28 coins the latest coin was of Lucius Verus, dated to 167 AD. These addenda fit broadly in the pattern of the earlier find but extend the date of the find. There are at least three sestertii in this group, whereas the earlier find contained dupondii / asses only. The comparative frequency of finds of sestertii after the Antonine period has been noted for the Isle of Wight[2]. The identifiable coins appear to be 'coins of British association'; the as of Antoninus Pius depicting Britannia and the recently recorded type of Faustina II with Venus leaning on a column on the reverse (see discussion by S. Moorhead for another coin of this type recorded by the PAS in the Isle of Wight, IOW-1358B5).DispostionReturned to finders, digital images taken for www.finds.org.uk (photo ref by numbering system in footnotes after each weight) (PAS ID = IOW-4DDD66).Summary:Uncertain Nero or Vespasian (AD 54-79)1Domitian (AD 81-96)1Hadrian (AD 117-38)2Sabina1Uncertain Hadrian or Pius1Antoninus Pius (AD 138-61)8Faustina II1Uncertain Antonine emperor1Commodus (AD 180-192)1Illegible7Total24CATALOGUEUNCERTAIN NERO or VESPASIAN (1)            No.                                    Obverse                                    Reverse                                    Bust                                    BMC                                    RIC                                    Qty                                    Weight                                1.

      "Ten bronze nummi coins. All the coins are of a denomination commonly known as the nummus. The final coin of the group was produced in AD 348, during the joint reign of Constantius II (AD 337-61) and his younger brother Constans (AD 337-50). Both had been brought up as Christians by their father Constantine the Great (AD 306-37) the first emperor to adopt the faith. Constans was the last legitimate emperor to visit Britain.The rest of the coins present were minted during AD 330s. Only one carries the bust of Constantine the Great himself with a reverse design of two soldiers with legionary standards between them (with motto Gloria Exercitus, to the glory of the army). The others consist of two commemorative types of the same period celebrating the twin capitals of the late Roman Empire: Rome and Constantinople. These coins carry the busts of the personifications of these cities and their reverses an appropriate emblem (the legendary she-wolf suckling Romulus and Remus for Rome, and a Victory on prow for Constantinople to recall the naval victory that enabled Constantine to found his new city). The coins were produced at a number of mints around the empire (with an expected bias towards those within, or closest to, Britain).These coins belong to one coinage system and form a discrete compositional group of coins that would have been current in Britain towards the middle of the fourth century AD.",

      "Found with the aid of a metal detector, 26.9.06 (Treasure reference 2006 T467), with a further ten coins found during subsequent archaeological investigation by Archaeology South East (Treasure case number 2008 T285).This group consists of 4653 coins made in the fourth century AD from AD 330-350. Each coin, generally known today as a nummus,is predominantly copper-alloy with a tiny admixture of silver. The legends on the reverse of the last nummi present, those of AD 348-50, invariably read FEL(ix) TEMP(orum) REPARATIO which can be translated as 'happy times are here again' ('Fel Temp' on summary). It was an optimistic hope prompted by the year 348 coinciding with the 1,100th anniversary of the traditional founding of Rome and the belief that it marked the beginning of a new age for the embattled empire. The group terminates during the joint reign of Constantius II (AD 337-61) and his younger brother Constans (AD 337-50). Both had been brought up as Christians by their father Constantine the Great (AD 306-37) the first emperor to adopt the faith. Constans was the last legitimate emperor to visit Britain.There are also coins present dating to before the joint reign of Constantius II and Constans; including issues of Constantine the Great himself, his mother St Helena and step-mother Theodora as well as another, shorter-lived, son Constantine II (d. AD 350) and a nephew Delmatius (d. AD 337). There are also over a thousand commemorative coins present celebrating the joint capitals at this time, Rome and Constantinople; produced in the AD 330s they do not bear an emperor's head. The other coins in the following summary are grouped by reverse type and then by the member of the imperial college depicted on the front of the coin. There is also a small quantity of ancient forgeries listed here as 'irregular'.Summary (including addenda coins): Early nummi, 11 AD 330s: Urbs Roma, 541 Constantinopolis, 546 + 2 add Gloria Exercitus (2 standards) (AD 330-5) Constantine I, 264 Constantine II, 311 + 1 add Constantius II, 262 Constans, 7 Uncertain emperor, 8 Gloria Exercitus (1 standard) (AD 335-40) Constantine I, 36 Constantine II Caesar, 133 Constantius II Caesar, 81 Constans Caesar, 35 Delmatius, 21 Constantine II Augustus, 20 Constantius II Augustus, 239 + 1 add Constans Augustus, 246 + 1 add Constans Caes / Aug, 4 Urbs Roma (GE1 reverse), 1 Emperor uncertain,52 Other types of AD 337-40: Divus Constantine I, 12 Helena, 152 Theodora, 50 Securitas Reip: Constantius II, 1 Constans, 1 Virtus Augusti: Constantine II, 1 Virtus Augg nn: Constantius II, 4 Constans, 1 Uncertain, 1 Victoria Augg (AD 340-8) Constans, 3 Victoria Augustorum (AD 342-3) Constans, 1 Two Victories (AD 346-8) Constantius II, 265 Constans, 1094 + 5 add Uncertain emperor, 71 Vot xx Mult xxx (AD 347-8): Constans, 1 Emperor uncertain, 1 Fel Temp coinage (AD 348-50) Constantius II, 1 Constans, 1 Uncertain brockage, Constans Augustus, 1 Irregular nummi, 53 Uncertain minor fragments 110 From the same find?Chronologically the coins belong to one coinage system and form a discrete compositional group of coins that would have been current in Britain around the middle of the fourth century AD.Itemisation of the ten copper alloy nummi of Constans and the House of Constantine, minted between AD330 and 348.

      "45 silver coins, second addenda to a hoard discovered near Dereham, Norfolk. This group is 2008T640. The original hoard discovery (of 1008 coins) is 2004T463 (TAR 2004, p. 177, no. 439), and the first addenda (43 coins) was 2006T149 (TAR 2005/6, p. 193, no. 1087). Neither of the previous discoveries currently have PAS records.Circumstances of discovery: Found by Mr Pat and Mrs Sally Buckley whilst searching with metal detectors on arable land between November 2008 and January 2009.Description: 44 silver denarii and 1 silver radiate ranging in date from Vespasian (69-79) to Gordian III (238-44). These were found in the same limited area as the large hoard of over 1,000 coins discovered by the same finders from 2004. This ended in c240, and these coins are perfectly typical of the contents of that hoard. Likewise, they share the same features of patination and there is no doubt they represent further remains of this dispersed hoard.Catalogue:1) Vespasian, 72-3, RIC 422) Vespasian, 79, RIC 1133) Trajan, 114-7, RIC 3374) Hadrian, 134-8, RIC 299a5) Diva Faustina I, 141, RIC 3626) Marcus Aurelius as Caesar, 148-9, RIC 4447) Faustina II, 145-61, RIC 502a8) Commodus, 190, RIC 2089) Didius Julianus, 193, RIC 110) Clodius Albinus, 195-7, RIC 36b11) Septimius Severus, 195, RIC 6112) Septimius Severus, 195-6, RIC 6813) Septimius Severus, 196-7, RIC 96a14) Septimius Severus, 197, RIC 10415) Septimius Severus, 197, RIC 10616) Septimius Severus, 198-200, RIC 514 (Laodicea)17) Septimius Severus, 205, RIC 19718) Julia Domna, 196-211, RIC 55119) Julia Domna, 196-211, RIC 56020) Julia Domna, 196-211, RIC 57221) Julia Domna, 196-211, RIC 57622) Plautilla, 202-5, RIC 36723) Caracalla, 196-8, RIC 11a24) Caracalla, 203, RIC 6925) Caracalla, 205, RIC 8226) Geta, 203-8, RIC 38b27) Caracalla, 214, RIC 238A28) Macrinus, 217-8, RIC 80a29) Elagabalus, 218-22, RIC 73b30) Elagabalus, 218-22, RIC 7831) Elagabalus, 218-22, RIC 95b32) Elagabalus, 218-22, RIC 123b33) Julia Paula, 219-20, RIC 22234) Julia Paula, 219-20, RIC 22235) Julia Maesa, 218-23, RIC 27236) Julia Mamaea, 222-35, RIC 36037) Severus Alexander, 222, RIC 5c38) Severus Alexander, 230, RIC 10239) Severus Alexander, 222-8, RIC 127c40) Severus Alexander, 222-8, RIC 127c41) Severus Alexander, 222-8, RIC 13342) Severus Alexander, 222-8, RIC 13343) Severus Alexander, 222-8, RIC 16844) Gordian III, 238-9, RIC 4 (radiate)45) Gordian III, 241, RIC 129Date: The initial part of the hoard was deposited c. 240; these coins are also of the first, second or early third century date and were no doubt deposited with the main group in c. 240.Conclusion: These coins represent addenda to the large Near Dereham hoard (2004T463, 2006T149) and, as silver coins of greater than 300 years antiquity and deposited together, they qualify as Treasure.",

      "2008T102 Exeter, Devon REPORT TO H M CORONER Circumstances of Discovery On 8 February 2008, archaeologists working for Exeter Archaeology discovered 22 copper alloy coins during controlled excavations. The coins All of the coins were heavily mineralised and in extremely fragile condition. However, ten of the 22 could be at least partially identified. The earliest appears to be a copper as of Augustus (c. 23 BC-AD 14), while the latest identifiable issues are of the reign of Claudius (AD 41-54). Although the remaining 12 coins were far too corroded to allow any identification, there was nothing to suggest that the hoard post-dated the Julio-Claudian period. That said a later first century (or even second century) deposition date cannot be ruled out. This group is extremely unusual for a hoard of Roman copper alloy coins due to the inclusion of such early types.The coins can be summarised as follows: Augustus (probable) 1 Claudius 6 Antonia 2 Claudius (possible) 1 Uncertain 12 Total 22 Age, number and metal The coins easily satisfy the criteria of the Treasure Act with regard to their age, metal and quantity; being more than 300 years old, struck in copper alloy and being more than ten in number. Of the same find? The circumstances of discovery make it clear that the coins were all deposited together in antiquity. Furthermore, the archaeological context suggests that the coins were deposited as part of a cremation burial. A number of other Roman artefacts, including glass, pottery, metalwork and organics were discovered from the same archaeological context (comprising archaeological context nos. 3053-56). The material listed on the attached document should all be considered Treasure by association with the coins. Conclusion I conclude that this find constitutes a prima facie case of treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).Ian Leins Curator of Iron Age and Roman coins The Department of Coins and Medals The British Museum 10 June 2008",

All three are the main silver coin denominations of the period: the siliqua. Indeed the nature of such silver coins, which have been clipped of the silver at their edges, indicate that they are part of the recycled coin circulation which had continued to use old stock of coinage during the early fifth century after the island was cut off and no new issues were available (AD c.410).CatalogueAD 360-3, Julian, 1AD 395-402, joint reign of Honorius & Arcadius, 2Age and metal-contentThe coins are certainly over three hundred years old and thus meet the requirements of the Treasure Act in this respect.

      "All the coins are a mixture of first and second century AD copper alloy denominations known as sestertii, dupondii and asses (1 sestertius = 2 dupondii and 1 dupondius = 2 asses).and are mostly worn in appearance. The first eleven coins were found in May 2010 and an addendum of six more in May 2013. These six, coming in after the original group had gone through the Treasure process, are marked with an asterisk in the catalogue. The group stretches from the late first century AD (a worn coin of the Emperor Domitian) to the late Severan dynasty (a sestertius of Severus Alexander of AD227). Wear patterns are generally consistent with the coins having come from the same hoard.The group can be summarised as follows:Summary (all sestertii except for 5 dupondii / asses as noted):Domitian (AD 81-96) 1 (dp/as)*Trajan, (AD98-101), as, obverse IMP CAES NER[...], Laureate head right, drapery at far shoulder, reverse TR POT[...], Victory advancing left, weight 11.43g*Hadrian, (AD134-8), sestertius, obverse [...], laureate head right, reverse HILARI[...], Hilaritas standing, RIC II, 970, weight 24.78gHadrian (AD 117-38) - Aelius Caesar 1 (dp/as)Antoninus Pius (AD 138-61) 1 (dp)*Marcus Aurelius as Caesar (AD145-61), as, obverse AVRELIV[...], bareheaded, draped and cuirassed (from rear) bust right, reverse [...]COS, Minerva standing left, weight 11.01g*Marcus Aurelius (AD161-80), sestertius, obverse [...], laureate head or bust right, reverse illegible, weight 22.96gMarcus Aurelius (AD 161-80) 3Lucius Verus (AD 161-9) 1Divus Pius 1Faustina II 2Commodus Caesar 1*Commodus, (AD180-92), sestertius, obverse [...]VREL COMMODVS AVG[...], laureate head right, reverse [...], female standing left, weight 22.51g*Severus Alexander, (AD227), sestertius, obverse [...]SEV ALEXAN[...], laureate, draped bust right, reverse [...]P VI C[...], Mars advancing right, RIC IV.2, 456, weight 19.57gTotal 17Metal Content and Age The coins satisfy the terms of the Treasure Act with regard to age and quantity, being base metal coins over than 300 years old and more than ten pieces. Of the same find? The composition of issues and their relative degrees of circulation wear fit well with that which might be expected for a small hoard of Roman coins of mixed low denominations deposited late in the second century AD. Recommendation I conclude that these eleven coins constitute a prima facie case of treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).Richard Abdy",

      "Treasure case 2010 T278: Hoard of Siliqua, acquired by the Museum of Somerset61 AR siliquae and 1 half-siliqua to AD 395Circumstances of discovery The hoard was found by Mr. D. Crisp on 9th April 2010 whilst metal-detecting on recently cultivated pasture. It was found in the same field as the large radiate hoard known as the Frome hoard. The coins were dispersed in an area of topsoil about 40 metres square, at the entrance to the field. A twisted piece of wire reported as being found with the coins was found to be modern.Description of the find The find consisted of sixty-one silver siliquae (a number of which were fragmentary) and an anonymous silver half-siliqua of Trier. A number of the coins survived only as fragments, and some appear to have been damaged by ploughing, as their broken edges looked fresh. The latest coin is that of Eugenius (no. 41), issued before 395. The half-siliqua is undated but thought to date to the 390s AD. This end date is relatively unusual for British siliqua hoards, which more commonly end with the period 395-402. The fact that few of the siliquae in this hoard are clipped (c.18%) and then only lightly clipped ('clipping factor 1') supports this earlier date for the deposition of the hoard, clipping being thought to be indicative of the later circulation of these types beyond the 380s.A full catalogue is available on request.See also addendum 2011 T233, SOM-111833.",

They were later taken to the British Museum for removal from the vessel and cleaning in the conservation laboratory before identification and cataloguing. Description of Find:In total, 662 coins were discovered, all late Roman silver coins of the denominations known as miliarenses (of which there were 9) and siliquae (of which there were 653). The earliest coins present were those of the emperor Constantius II minted in 355-361 AD. The latest coins were those of the emperors Arcadius and Honorius minted in Milan between 395 and 402 AD.

      "Hoard of 4,387 almost exclusively 3rd-century radiates, with the exception of a denarius of Carinus (283-285 AD). The coins begin with Volusian (251-253 AD) and terminate with those of Carausius (286-293 AD).British Museumreport:This report will consider these coins with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure act (1996): Namely, their age, precious metal content and whether the coins can be said to come from the same find.Description of FindThe coins range in date from AD 251-293, a time of great political upheaval in the Roman world; as is demonstrated by the plethora of rulers represented in this relatively short period. The group is broadly similar in composition to the many Romano-British coin hoards (at least 200 so far recorded) buried in the aftermath of the breakaway 'Gallic Empire'. The Gallic empire, whose capital was at the city of Trier but which had held dominion over Britain, was established in AD 260 and reconquered by the legitimate ('central') emperor Aurelian in AD 274. The coins also just extend into a second breakaway usurpation which occurred in AD 286/7 leading to the seven year reign of Carausius as a Roman emperor (more correctly a usurper) in Britain with sway over part of the near Continent.Summary by reign: Philippa Walton with Henry FlynnCentral EmpireVolusian (AD 251-3), 1Joint reign of Valerian and Gallienus (AD 253-60)Valerian I, 2Gallienus, 1Saloninus, 1Gallienus & Salonina (AD 260-8)Gallienus, 516Salonina, 36 (incl. 8 uncertain issue)Claudius II (AD 268-70), 617Quintillus (AD 270), 45Aurelian (AD 270-5), 24Severina, 1Tacitus (AD 275-6), 15Florian (AD 276), 1Probus (AD 276-82), 31Carus (AD 282-3), 1Carinus Caesar, 1Numerian Augustus (AD 283-4), 1Carinus Augustus (AD 283-5), 1Divus Carus, 1Joint reign of Diocletian & Maximian (AD 284-93)Diocletian, 8Maximian, 3Gallic EmpirePostumus (AD 260-9), 46Marius (AD 269), 5Victorinus (AD 269-71), 806Tetricus I (AD 271-4), 1099Tetricus II, 594Uncertain Tetricus I or Victorinus, 142Britannic EmpireCarausius (AD 286-93), 8Irregular, 9Illegible, 371The coins are all of the denomination known as radiates, originally a silver multiple of the denarius, but by this time had become debased to the point of being essentially bronze (less than 5% silver).ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being bronze coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces. 18 sherds of Roman coarse grey pottery, found at the same time and possibly the hoard container, should also be considered treasure by its association with the coins.Richard AbdyDept. of Coins and MedalsBritish Museum23.7.09",

      "The hoard comprises Roman coins produced in the quarter-century following Diocletian's reform of the Roman imperial coinage around A.D. 294-5. The coins are of copper alloys that contain small proportions of added silver, originally with silver-washed surfaces. As found, almost all coins are encrusted with copper corrosion products, mainly malachite. The coins have been washed in the museum to remove superficial soil deposits, but have not otherwise been cleaned or conserved. Many of the coins from this hoard [08.4] form clusters or rouleaux of up to nine coins, held together by corrosion products and/or soil; these have as yet not been separated, so the precise make-up of this hoard has yet to be determined.",

      "Summary of the Shrewsbury hoard18 radiates and 9297 nummi to AD 335The 9,315 coins were contained in a broken 'Severn Valley' ware jar. The subsequent archaeological excavation recovered a scatter of coins in the immediate area and some associated pottery sherds (from the jar). The pot had originally been placed in a pit and was covered by a large flat stone.The majority of the coins present were nummi minted between AD 307 and 335. Eighteen radiates were also present. The latest dated coins in the hoard can be dated to AD 333-335. The internal stratigraphy of the pot suggests that the latest coins were added in a later deposition event. Within the lower layers of the pot were several fragments of a linen textile and an iron nail.A summary of the hoard is given below. (The radiates are listed by emperor's reign and the nummi in groupings by the dates of the reverse designs). The 277 coins from the archaeological excavation are included in this summary as they are likely to have come from the hoard.

      "86 Bronze Roman coins dating to the 1st - 2nd century AD. Prob deposition date c. 180 ish AD.Latest securely datable coin is Antoninus Pius, TR P XVIII (AD 154-5), but closing date is given as AD 161 due to the less datable issues of the reign present (e.g. the Faustina II coins). The coins were typically in poor states of preservation and no images were taken at the British Museum.The Pottery by Peter ReavillTwenty-one sherds of an oxidised (red coloured) coarseware pottery vessel / storage jar of early Roman date. These sherds represent approximately 1/3 of the entire vessel used to deposit this Roman hoard in, and include a large section of the base of the pot. Many of the sherds have a mid-green concreted copper alloy corrosion product adhering to them; this directly associated them with the coins described herein. The style of the vessel is well documented being made from the local 'Severn Valley Ware' having a fine, micaceous fabric containing occasional limestone fragments, ill-sorted rounded quartz and iron ore. Multiple kiln sites for the production of this pottery are postulated but few have been excavated. Production of this 'ware' is thought to start in the 1st century AD and continue into the late 4th (Ellis, 2000:247-248).One residual sherd of Mortaria, dated to the late 1st - 3rd century AD. This sherd should be considered as residual and therefore not part of the hoard. As such it is not to be considered as treasure as it is not directly associated with the deposit of coins.Large limestone block: It has been noted that similar stones have been associated with hoards in Shropshire (2008-T356 Hoard of Coins from the Oswestry Area, and 2009-T450 Hoard of coins from the Shrewsbury Area) being used as potential lids for the vessels / or findspot markers. In this case there is no direct evidence for the association between the hoard and stone.Bibliography:Ellis, P. (ed.) 2000: The Roman Baths and Macellum at Wroxeter. English Heritage Report 9.

      "1121 Roman silver denarii to AD 64 BM ref.: 2008 T410Date of discovery: July 2008 Circumstances of discovery: The finder uncovered a Roman white ware pot containing a large proportion of the coins whilst metal detecting, the remaining coins were found subsequently in the vicinity. Although, members of the Warmington Historical Society have been investigating parts of this site, which contains Roman features, the finder was not detecting in the same area as the Society were excavating.Discussion: We have examined the coins and found there to be 773 Republican and 348 early Imperial denarii; the earliest identifiable coin is a ROSTRUM TRIDENS (206-195 BC) and the latest is a PONTIF MAX TR P X COS IIII of Nero (63/4AD). The majority of the coins present will have a high silver content of between 80 and 98%.Early Roman hoards of this nature are not uncommon and one or two other, much smaller examples have been discovered within Warwickshire (eg. the Great Packington Hoard, Treasure Annual Reports for 1998-99 and 2002)Summary Republic, 772 Augustus (31 BC-AD 14), 314 Claudius (AD 41-54), 15 Nero Caesar, 1 Nero (AD 54-68), 15 Illegible, 2 Irregular, 2Conclusion: As a hoard of more than two associated coins, each containing over 10% precious metal and more than 300 years old, this find qualifies as treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996.",

      "With the exception of one (very battered) coin from the first century AD, the coins range in date from AD 260-c290 and is broadly similar in composition to the many Romano-British coin hoards (at least 200 so far recorded) buried in the aftermath of the breakaway 'Gallic Empire'. The Gallic empire, whose capital was at the city of Trier but which had held dominion over Britain, was established in AD 260 and reconquered by the legitimate ('central') Empire in AD 274. In addition there are some coins of the 'Britannic Empire' initiated by Carausius (AD 286-93) who separated the British provinces (and briefly northern France) until it was reabsorbed by the legitimate Emperors in AD 296.Summary by reign:Central EmpireVespasian (AD 69-79) 1Gallienus (sole reign, AD 260-8) 9 161Claudius II (AD 268-70) 16Divus Claudius II 2Gallic EmpirePostumus (AD 260-9) 1Victorinus (AD 269-71) 23Tetricus I & II (AD 271-4) 53uncertain Victorinus or Tetricus I 17Britannic EmpireCarausius (AD 287-93) 8irregular (ancient forgery) 1emperor illegible 44Total 175Metal ContentAll but two coins are all of the denomination known as radiates, originally a silver multiple of the denarius, but by this time had become debased to the point of being essentially bronze (c.1% silver). One older silver denarius is present as is one completely bronze lower denomination (sestertius).Pottery reported with the coins byRichard Hobbs10 sherds of Roman pottery found with a hoard of 175 coins with latest date of c AD290. Six of the sherds come from the same vessel, and consist of five body and one rim sherd of a vessel, probably a small jar. The fabric is brown-orange with irregular black grit inclusions. The other four sherds consist of two fragments larger thicker fragments of cermic with an orange fabric with a grey core, and two small undiagnostic fragments of ceramic, heavily rolled and abraded.Although the six sherds might conceivably be fragments of a hoard container there is no means of establishing this for certain without a direct association with the coins or circumstantial evidence such as staining.",

      "Circumstances of Find During archaeological investigation by Cotswold Archaeology Ltd in advance of building work for the new Bath Spa, 16th November 2007.The Beau Street hoard 2007 T677 Summary of contents for valuation The hoard consists of eight archaeologically discrete bags of coins kept together as excavated from the block and listed as separate summaries below (bags 1-8). In addition to these eight groups there were some coins that could not be assigned to a bag that were removed during the excavation of the soil block in the laboratory. These are listed in the final summary, as overall contents by emperor and then as stored (in bags relating to their stratigraphic position in the block, as removed in the laboratory). Some of these groups may be related to particular bags and others have no known context. Additional to this is the material studied by Richard Reece that formed the basis of the initial coroner's report in 2007. A proportion of this is now display in Bath and was catalogued by Richard Abdy before it went to Bath. It was difficult to reconcile the summary by Richard Reece with the actual coins remaining at the BM and so they have been re-counted and summarised with the loose material in the final group below.

V[RBS ROMA]; Roma seated left on throne, [holding victory on globe and reverse spear]Mintmark: [-]//TRPSRIC IX, pp. 19 & 22, c.f. nos. 27/45Discussion: Part of the same hoard as 2007 T719 and 2008 T743. These fragments have been checked against the previous ones by the finder and none clearly join. Late 4th century silver coins are comparatively rare site finds in Britain. The close proximity of the findspots, along with the presence of a Miliarenses amongst the previous finds, suggests the coins were originally deposited together in a hoard or lost together, for example in a purse, and should therefore be considered as of the same find.Further searches around the findspot have failed to identify any more coins or an obvious concentration. The fragmentary nature of all the coins retrieved suggests the hoard has been scattered and damaged by the plough with more being brought to light every year as the site is turned over by the plough.As they are over 300 years old and contain over 10% precious metal they should therefore be considered Treasure within the meaning of the Treasure Act 2006.",

      "After inspection 24 of the recovered coins, all large copper alloy nummi of Constantius II, Constans and Magnentius, were recognized as being from a dispersed hoard and were separated.Description of findAll 24 coins are large copper alloy nummi of Constantius II, Constans and Magnentius which, with the exception of one irregular imitation, were all struck at the Roman empire's Western mints between 348 and 353. These coins are relatively uncommon as stray finds and the presence of so many together in one area is good evidence for the constituent coins being part of a hoard dispersed at some time during the past.CatalogueConstantius II, Trier mint, TRS, LRBC 42, 348-50Constans, Trier mint, TRS, LRBC 43, 348-50Constantius II, Arles mint, A/-//SARL, LRBC 410, 348-50Constantius II or Constans, Arles mint, A/-//SARL, LRBC 411/413, 348-50Constans, uncertain mint, [...], emperor on galley, 348-50Constantius II or Constans, uncertain mint, A/-//[...], emperor on galley, 348-50Constantius II or Constans, uncertain mint, [...], emperor on galley, 348-50Constantius II, uncertain mint, [...], illegible, 348-53Constantius II or Constans, uncertain mint, [...], illegible reverse, 348-50Uncertain emperor, uncertain mint, [...], emperor on galley, 348-51Uncertain emperor, uncertain mint, [...], emperor on galley, 348-51Uncertain emperor, uncertain mint, [...], emperor on galley, 348-51Uncertain emperor, uncertain mint, [...], emperor on galley, 348-51Uncertain emperor, uncertain mint, [...], emperor on galley, 348-51Magnentius, Trier mint, [...], LRBC 48, 350-1Magnentius, Trier mint, -/A//TRS, LRBC 50, 350-1Magnentius, Lyons mint, RPLG, LRBC 214, 350-1Magnentius, Arles mint, SAR.L, LRBC 425, 350-1Magnentius, uncertain mint, [...], emperor on horseback (1/2), 350-1Magnentius, uncertain mint, -/A//[...], emperor standing (2), 350-1Magnentius, Amiens mint, -//AMB[..], Two Victories (2), 351-3Magnentius, irregular mint, -/A//[...], emperor standing (2), c351-3Uncertain emperor, uncertain mint, [...], illegible, 348-53Uncertain emperor, uncertain mint, [...], illegible, 348-53The Treasure ActThe Treasure Act states that ten or more copper alloy coins of three hundred years age or more which were lost or deposited together constitute Treasure. The very close association of these 24 nummi makes it most unlikely they were not lost together or buried as a group. Thus, the overwhelming likelihood is that these coins constitute a hoard and so a priori represent a case of Treasure.",

      "Treasure case no: 2008 T7231048 Roman Coins and associated materialThis report will consider these coins with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure Act (1996): Namely, their age, precious metal content and whether the coins can be said to come from the same find.Circumstances of FindThis represents one of a series of treasure cases found with the aid of a metal detector earlier in the year; 22.10.08 (2008 T622) and 15.11.2008 (2008 T672). Given the similarity of the coins and the sharing of the same findspot, all these treasure cases were possibly part of the same hoarding event buried in multiple containers. These earlier cases may represent a single collection and have been termed 'Hoard A'. This case (2008 T723), found and reported intact in its original pot, is thought to be a discrete burial and is termed 'Hoard B'.Description of FindThe coins range in date from AD 251-274 and the group is broadly similar in composition to the many Romano-British coin hoards (over 200 so far recorded) buried in the wake of the breakaway 'Gallic Empire'. The Gallic empire, whose capital was at the city of Trier but which had held dominion over Britain, was established in AD 260 and reconquered by the legitimate ('central') emperor Aurelian in AD 274.Summary by reign (all radiates except where noted):Central EmpireVolusian (AD 251-3) 1Valerian & Gallienus (AD 253-60)Valerian I 2Gallienus 7Salonina 3Gallienus & Salonina (AD 260-8)Gallienus 66Salonina 1Claudius II (AD 268-70) 50Divo Claudio 1Quintillus (AD 270) 4Gallic EmpirePostumus (AD 260-9) 36Laelian (AD 269) 2Marius (AD 269) 2Victorinus (AD 269-71) 426Tetricus I (AD 271-4) 325Tetricus II 110Uncertain Gallic Emperor 8Uncertain emperor 1Irregular (ancient forgeries) 3Total 1048All are of the Roman denomination known as radiates, originally a silver multiple of the denarius, but by this time had become debased to the point of being essentially bronze (c.1% silver).Associated Pottery and other non-coin artefacts by Dr Richard HobbsDept. of Prehistory & Europe, British MuseumMostly intact indented beaker (there is slight damage to the rim) with bung of organic fibres. The fabric appears to be grey with an orange slip, although as the vessel has not been thoroughly cleaned this needs to be clarified. The beaker has five long indentations around the central body of the vessel, a slightly flared foot and a beaded rim. (Ht.: c. 196mm, D. of rim: 77mm, Rim thickness: 6.0mm)ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being base metal coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces. The pot and bung should also be considered treasure by its association with the coins.Richard AbdyDept. of Coins and MedalsBritish Museum",

      "CORONER'S REPORTThe coins were found by Mrs M. Dandy with the aid of a metal detector on 15th November 2008. Another hoard (2008 T622) was found at the same site on 22nd October 2008. Another hoard was found in the same area in an intact pot sealed with a bung on 20th November 2008 (2008 T723) by Mrs M. Dandy and Mrs E. Hood. Pottery brought in alongside these cases belonged to two vessels, as discussed below.Description The coins range in date from AD 253-282, with the exception of one much earlier coin of Trajan (AD 98-117) which is a rare survival by this period but not unheard of for hoards of this type. Otherwise the group is broadly similar in composition to other Romano-British coin hoards of this date. The last coins are represented by the final series of Probus at Lyon (plus one example of the penultimate series at Ticinum (Pavia, Italy)).Catalogue 1 AR denarius & 545 BI radiates and pot sherds to AD282This report will consider these coins with respect to the criteria laid down in the Treasure Act (1996): Namely, their age, precious metal content and whether the coins can be said to come from the same find.Circumstances of DiscoveryOne of a series of treasure cases found with the aid of a metal detector; 22.10.08 (2008 T622) and 15.11.2008 (2008 T672) have been labelled 'Hoard A'. 'Hoard B', in an intact pot sealed with bung, was discovered on 20.11.2008 (2008 T723). Given the similarity of the coins and the sharing of the same findspot, all these treasure cases were possibly part of the same hoarding event buried in multiple containers.Latest coinsLast coins are represented by the final series of Probus at Lyon (plus one example of the penultimate series at Ticinum).Summary:CENTRAL EMPIRE Rome Gaul Milan Ticinum Siscia Others Uncertain TotalTrajan (AD 98-117) 1 - - - - - - 1Valerian & Gallienus (AD 253-60)Gallienus 2 1 - - - - - 3Divus Valerian II 1 - - - - - - 1Gallienus & Salonina (AD 260-8)Gallienus 40 - 2 - 2 - - 44Salonina - - 1 - - - - 1Claudius II (AD 268-70) 36 - 7 - 3 - - 46Divus Claudius 3 - - - - - - 3Quintillus (AD 270) 2 - - - - - - 2Aurelian (AD 270-5) - - 1 - 1 - - 2Tacitus (AD 275-6) - 5 - - - - - 5Probus (AD 276-82) - 5 - 1 - - - 6Total 85 11 11 1 6 - - 114GALLIC EMPIRE Mint I Mint II Milan Uncertain TotalPostumus (AD 260-9) 3 1 - - 4Marius (AD 269) 1 - - - 1Victorinus (AD 269-71) 70 39 - - 109Tetricus I (AD 271-4) 134 46 - 5 185Tetricus II 72 14 - - 86Total 280 100 - 5 385Irregular - - - 47 47Grand total 546The Pottery and associated finds by Dr Richard HobbsDept. of Prehistory & Europe, The British MuseumVessel 114 sherds of a wheel-thrown vessel of uncertain form; the base is more or less complete (in two joining fragments), the remainder of the sherds all appear to be body sherds. Some, although not all, have copper corrosion on their inner surface. The fabric is well sorted, whitish grey with black inclusions, an orangey finish with blackening on the outer surface. Some sherds are decorated with shallow striations. The vessel can be confidently associated with the coin hoard/s.Vessel 27 sherds of a vessel much thicker and coarser than vessel 1; there are 3 fragments of base, the rest are body sherds. The fabric has an orange inner surface, a grey outer surface with a grey/black core. There are no obvious traces of copper corrosion, but despite this there is no particular reason to doubt this vessel is another coin hoard container.In addition to these two vessels are:- 4 fragments of tile;- 4 pieces of stone;- a large slab of stone and 2 further pieces which are annotated as 'covering the dimpled pot' (2008 T723);- 2 bags of soil;- 1 bag of small finds (11 in total), all post-med. and including a piece of lead shot, a couple of buttons/studs, and various other miscellaneous fragments.Apart from the pieces of stone, which could conceivably have been placed over the mouth of the one of the vessels to protect the contents, none of the material listed immediately above can be considered associated.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being bronze coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than ten pieces. The pot and the stone pieces, but none of the other itemised pieces listed by Dr Hobbs, should also be considered treasure by virtue of their association with the coins.",

      "TREASURE CASE : 2008 T531.75 Roman Silver, 10 Roman Bronze coins and a pot sherdAll of the coins were found within an area of 30 x 30 yards; some coins were on the surface with others at a maximum depth of nine inches. Also discovered was a whitish-grey sherd (wt. 36.96g) from the base of a small jar, which had probably once been the container for the coins. (Pots associated with coin hoards are usually buried upright - once smashed by plough activity the base of the pot stands the best chance of survival.)The coins were issued by the following Roman emperors (grouped here by joint reigns, note irregular coins are ancient forgeries):silver siliquae:AD 355-60, Constantius II & Julian Caesar & 360-3; Julian Augustus, 5 (1 x Trier, 3 x Arles, 1 x Lyon)AD 364-7, Valentinian I & Valens, 10 (2 x Arles, 6 x Lyon, 2 x Antioch)AD 367-75, Valentinian I, Valens & Gratian, 3 (all Trier)AD 375-8, Valens, Gratian, & Valentinian II, 4 (all Trier)AD 378/9-88, Gratian, Theodosius I, Valentinian II, Arcadius, Magnus Maximus & Flavius Victor, 6 (3 x Trier, 1 x Milan, 1 x Aquileia, 1 x uncertain mint)AD 388-95, Theodosius I, Valentinian II, Eugenius & Arcadius, 11 (6 x Trier, 2 x Lyon, 3 x Milan)AD 395-402, Honorius & Arcadius, 31 (all Milan)Irregular, 5base metal nummi:AD 364-78, Valentinian I (to 375), Valens, Gratian, & (from 375) Valentinian II, 6 (5 x Arles, 1 x uncertain)AD 388-95, Theodosius I, Valentinian II, Eugenius & Arcadius, 2 (1 x Arles, 1 x Lyon)Irregular, 2The coins from a fairly close-knit chronological grouping and could easily have been in circulation together before being deposited at the same time (as a hoard) in the early fifth century AD.Metal content?At this period great efforts were made by the Romans to refine gold and silver for their coinage (which carried mint-markings guaranteeing the processes) and such coins were usually as pure as was then technologically possible (greater than 95%). The nummi (singular nummus) represent the small change of the time and were essentially bronze coins.ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, I conclude that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being precious metal coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of more than two pieces. The bronze coins are treasure by being both base metal coins of the same find of ten or more pieces and also by being in association with the precious metal coins. The pot sherd should also be considered treasure by its association with the coins.",

      "Oswestry area I 2008 T356 A group of 92 silver coins were found by Mr XXXXX with the aid of a metal detector. The find was made and reported in June 2008 and the area was subsequently excavated by the finder and the Finds Liaison Officer, Peter Reavill on 10th of June. A further 5 silver coins and 3 small fragments of coins were found on that occasion, as well as part of an iron nail. The original group of coins (initial find) were found in pasture, concentrated in a small area and placed on top of a flat stone.Oswestry area II 2008 T526 A second group of 23 silver coins were found in September 2008 by the same finder scattered in the area of a depression about 50 to 80m from the first deposit. It is not clear if this group is part of the first group or was originally a distinct deposit. The dates of the coins are within those of the first group, which was disturbed to a limited extent by ploughing. However, Peter Reavill, who has examined the site, is of the opinion that these coins should be considered as a separate group due to the distance between them and their findspot distribution.The groups are kept separate in the summary which follows.The Coins: All of the coins are Roman silver coins of a denomination known as the denarius (plural denarii). The earliest coins in Group I were four Roman Republican denarii of Mark Antony dating to 32-31 BC; the latest coins in both groups were of Faustina II, wife of Marcus Aurelius (AD 161-180) who died in AD 176.In terms of composition this group of coins is consistent with other hoards of this period. The coins can be summarised as follows:Summary: Group I Group II Mark Antony (32-31 BC) 4 - Nero (AD 54-68) 1 1 Otho (AD 69) - 1 Vespasian (AD 69-79) 10 4 Vespasian or Titus Caesar 1 - Titus (AD 79-81) 3 1 Divus Vespasianus 2 - Domitian (AD 81-96) 7 1 Uncertain Flavian emperor 1 - Trajan (AD 98-117) 24 (inc. 1 mint of Lycia) 6 Hadrian (AD 117-138) 13 2 Aelius Caesar 1 - Sabina 1 - Antoninus Pius (AD 138-161) 11 1 Diva Faustina I 3 1 Faustina II 2 - Marcus Aurelius (AD 161-180) 4 - Divus Antoninus 2 1 Faustina II 3 1 Lucius Verus 2 - Lucilla 2 - Uncertain Emperor - 3 Unidentifiable fragments 3 - Total 97 (+ 3 fragments) 23 The Iron Nail The iron nail is fragmentary and not diagnostic in date.Metal Content and Age: The coins satisfy the terms of the Treasure Act with regard to age, quantity and metal content. They are certainly more than 300 years old and all have precious metal contents far in excess of the 10% threshold. Same find? The coins in both groups could have circulated together in the second century AD. The Republican denarii are very worn and of a type commonly found in later hoards. Composition and the circumstances of discovery, as reported, would therefore suggest that these coins formed either one hoard or two distinct deposits buried at a similar date.Recommendation: Given their age and metal content, and the circumstances of burial, I would conclude that these coins should be regarded as a prima facie case of treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).",

      "The coins All eight coins appear to be either Roman Republican or Imperial period silver denarii dating from between the first century BC and the first half of the first century AD. Only a fragment of one coin survives and they are in very worn condition, possibly burnt; it has not been possible to identify the fragment and three of the coins. The coins can be summarised as follows: 1. Denarius serratus of Q. Antonius Balbus, 82-83 BC, type RRC 364/1d (with control mark P on the reverse). 2. Denarius of C. Postumius, 74 BC, type RRC 394/1 3. Denarius of Brutus, 54 BC, type RRC 433/2 4. Denarius of Mark Antony, 32-31 BC, type RRC 544 5. Two Denarii of uncertain type and date, with head on obverse and horses / chariot on reverse, probably Roman Republican in date. 6. Denarius of uncertain type and date, head right on obverse. It is not certain whether this is a Roman Republican or Imperial denarius; the coin is too worn to identify. 7. Fragment of denarius of uncertain type and date. The same find? The coins are more or less contemporary with one another and coins of these types have previously been found together in hoards. Roman Republican coins are commonly found in hoards with early Imperial coins and a later date for one unidentified coin would therefore not alter the possibility of its association with the others. The circumstances of discovery would suggest that the coins could have been part of a scattered hoard. The later find of three coins should be considered part of the same group.",

      "Roman copper alloy radiate coin hoard, c 7,000 coins contained in a greyware storage jar.The coins range in date from AD 230s-290s, a time of great political upheaval in the Roman world; as is demonstrated by the plethora of rulers represented in the sample below in what is a relatively short period. The group is broadly similar in composition to the many Romano-British coin hoards (at least 200 so far recorded) buried in the aftermath of the breakaway 'Gallic Empire'. The Gallic empire, whose capital was at the city of Trier but which had held dominion over Britain, was established in AD 260 and reconquered by the legitimate ('central') emperor Aurelian in AD 274. The coins also just extend into a second breakaway usurpation which occurred in AD 286/7 leading to the seven year reign of Carausius as a Roman emperor (more correctly a usurper) in Britain with sway over part of the near Continent.The coins are all of the denomination known as radiates, originally a silver multiple of the denarius, but by this time had become debased to the point of being essentially bronze (less than 5% silver).Due to the concreted nature of the find a sample of 140 loose coins were examined and give the following proportions of rulers:?Gordian III (AD 238-44): No. = 1 % of total = 0.71%JOINT REIGN OF VALERIAN & GALLIENUS (AD 253-60)Salonina: No. = 1, % of total = 0.71%SOLE REIGN OF GALLIENUS (AD 260-8)Gallienus: No. = 24, % of total = 17.14%Claudius II (AD 268-70): No. = 20, % of total =14.29%Divus Claudius II: No. =1, % of total = 0.71%Quintillus (AD 270): No. =3, % of total = 2.14%GALLIC EMPIREPostumus (AD 260-9): No. = 2, % of total = 1.43%Victorinus (AD 269-71): No. =24, % of total =17.14%Divus Victorinus: No. =2, % of total = 1.43%Tetricus I (AD 271-4): No. = 29, % of total = 20.71%Tetricus II: No. =16, % of total = 11.43%Uncertain Gallic: No. = 1, % of total = 0.71%BRITANNIC EMPIRECarausius (AD 286-93): No. =1, % of total = 0.71%IRREGULAR: No. = 7, % of total = 5.00%ILLEGIBLE: No. = 8, % of total = 5.71%Estimation of total number of coins:Total weight of coin lump within pot = 13.3kg.Estimated of weight of pot = 1kg (made by scaling up a smaller empty greyware pot of known weight)Number of loose coins = 2388From which av. weight of uncleaned coin ascertained by BM conservator = 2.63gThus number of coins in fused lump of 12.3kg estimated as 4677 coins.Total = 7065 coinsNote on pottery associated with the hoard (by Dr Richard Hobbs, dept.

      "Coin hoard of 20 Roman coins, and 6 possibly related coins Date: 2nd - 4th CenturyIn broad chronological terms, these coins represent a quite normal spread from a rural Roman site. However, there is a very high proportion of coins of the House of Valentinian, AD 364-78 (20 out of 26 coins). Recent recording with the PAS has shown there to be a higher number of House of Valentinian coins spreading into North & East Yorkshire than had previously been considered.Of the other coins, two are a sestertius and a denarius (nos 1 & 2) from Reece periods 7 (AD 138-61) and 10 (AD 193-222) respectively. One is an as or dupondius that can only be dated to the 1st - 2nd Century (no. 3). Three are illegible radiates/nummi and can only be dated to 260-400.It is difficult to interpret this group, but the coins as a whole suggest Roman activity in the vicinity over a period of time. It is very unusual to have a site with no coins from c. 260-75 and 330-348 when there are earlier and later coins. It is possible that there was a significant amount of activity in the Valentinianic period, but it seems most likely that the 20 coins from this period represents a small hoard. Hoards of Valentinianic bronze coins tend to be most common in the south of Britain, notably in Gloucestershire, Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire. However, a small Valentinianic hoard was found at Old Winteringham in North Lincolnshire (Moorhead, Leahy and Harrison, forthcoming).Catalogue2nd to mid-3rd century coins1.

      "Two fourth-early fifth century ad gold solidii. The coins were issued by Honorius (AD 393-423), the last legitimate emperor to hold sway over Roman Britain. One coin is from the mint of Milan, the other from Ravenna (the latter exhibiting typical plough damage sometimes seen on coins that have undergone archaeological burial)They are of the same period and from the same findspot as a previous discovery of six gold solidi bringing the total to eight pieces:Summary:PeriodAD 388-95Theodosius I 1Valentinian II 1AD 395-402Arcadius 1Honorius 3AD 402-6Honorius 2total 8Metal content?At this period great efforts were made by the Romans to refine gold and silver for their coinage (they carried mint-markings guaranteeing the processes) and such coins were usually as pure as was then technologically possible (i.e. greater than 95%).ConclusionOn the balance of probabilities, therefore, it can be concluded that these coins belong together as a hoard and constitute a prima facie case of treasure by being precious metal coins of an antiquity greater than 300 years and are of one find of two or more pieces. They are most probably part of the previous Woodbridge find which now totals eight gold coins of the 4th - 5th century AD.Richard Abdy",

      "Treasure case no. 2003 T57 (disclaimed). Assessment and report by Malcolm Lyne Arch.Dip.(Lon.), PhD, FSA  The 120 coins were quantified by period as per Reece's system (1991) as follows:                  TABLE 1        Period Date-range  No.  %    Period Date-range  No.  %        1       Up to 41    3  2.5   12     238-260      6  5.0        2       41-54       -   -    13     260-275     48 40.0       3       54-68       1  0.8   14     275-296     21 17.5       4       69-96       -   -    15     296-317      2  1.7       5       96-117      -   -    16     317-330      -   -       6       117-138     1  0.8   17     330-348     11  9.2       7       138-161     1  0.8   18     348-364      4  3.3       8       161-180     -   -    19     364-378     15 12.5        9       180-192     -   -    20     378-388      -   -       10      193-222     1  0.8   21     388-403      -   -        11      222-238     -   -    Illeg               6  5.0  The coin totals in this table were then converted into numbers per 1000 in order to compare with Reece's quantification of coin assemblages from 140 Romano-British sites. What this revealed is that the percentages of coins for periods 12 and 13 (238-275) are abnormally high. Examination of the coins belonging to these two periods leaves little or no doubt that the abnormality is caused by a dispersed hoard deposited c.AD.270.  Certain components of this hoard of antoniniani are as follows:  Gordian III (238-244). A:2003.40.91, 121 (2 coins) Mariniana (253-260). A:2003.40.95 (1 coin) Valerian I (253-260). A:2003.40.73, 94, 116 (3 coins) Postumus (259-266). A:2003.40.17, 18, 22, 23, 30, 45, 46, 63, 72, 74, 75, 76, 77, 92, 98, 99, 104, 105, 106 (19 coins)  All of these coins are in silver alloy  The following antoniniani or some of them may also be part of this hoard but are in a more debased cu.alloy  Gallienus (258-268). A:2003.40.9, 67, 80, 103 (4 coins) Claudius II (268-270). A:2003.40.19, 27, 34, 48, 51, 54, 84 (7 coins) Postumus (266-268). A:2003.40.6, 7, 8, 21, 71, 93, 108 (7 coins) Postumus or Victorinus (266-270). A:2003.40.11, 107, 111, 118, 120 (5 coins) Victorinus (268-270). A:2003.40.35, 79, 113, 114 (4 coins) Tetricus I (270-273). A:2003.40.13, 49 (2 coins)  The varying condition of these coins suggests that the hoard has slowly been dispersed by ploughing over a number of years, with some being disturbed very recently. There has been considerable corrosion  of the surfaces of nearly all of the more debased cu.alloy antoniniani and some of the earlier silver alloy ones. The question arises as to whether the hoard is now totally dispersed or the residue of it is still in situ somewhere in the field. As things stand it is a very small hoard of somewhere between 25 and 54 coins.  The only other unusual aspect of the coin assemblage is the presence of two heavily debased legionary denarii of Marc Antony struck to pay his troops before the battle of Actium in 31 BC. One of these has a graffito in ?Greek cut into its surface and should be looked at by an epigraphist: Ancient Greek coins given as offerings at shrines sometimes have graffiti. There is nothing particularly unusual about the fourth-century coinage from this site and all could be the result of casual coin loss.

      "Report by Richard Abdy, Department of Coins & Medals, The British Museum.Description of FindSilver & Copper Alloy Coin Hoard.2 AE sestertii and 72 AE dupondii / asses to AD 98 \t\t\t\t\tBM ref.: 2006 T409 (+ 3 copper-alloy objects and 7 non-hoard coins)\t\t\t(addenda 2007 = BM ref.: 2007 T197)DiscussionAlthough it contains a high number illegible or part-legible coins this Flavian aes hoard shows the usual characteristics of D. R. Walker's 'period of sporadic supply' of base metal coinage to Britain in the first century.  Claudian copies, Lyon mint bronze AD 64-67 (reign of Nero), AD 71-73 and 77-78 (Vespasian), and Rome mint bronze of AD 86-87 (Domitian). With the original find, the latest accurately datable coin is of 87 (Domitian COS XIII). The 2007 addenda has produced an as of Nerva (TR P and COS illegible), moving the closing date of the hoard to AD 98. (The earliest coin is now an as of Caligula from the 2007 addenda).Non-hoard coinsThe six late Roman coins that were found alongside are probably intrusive to the current case and the five fourth century nummi might even be addenda to the Shorwell I (1932) find (RBCH 1382) with was not reported in detail but was a hoard of 22 fourth century coins including 'four of the Valentinianic dynasty'.Deposition Returned to finders. Due to the highly corroded condition of the coins only digital images of 2, 3, 7, 11, 17-19 are available at the British Museum.The Cu-alloy object \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby Jody Joy Length: 45mm Weight: 9.8gDescription of ObjectHollow conical shaped object. Tapers to a rounded point at one end. There are striations running in straight lines along the object and traces of decoration at the un-tapered end.   Discussion: An un-diagnostic copper-alloy object of uncertain date. The surface patina indicates that it is probably ancient. It could have been a component from a composite object, the rest having not survived.ConclusionThis object is of uncertain date and uncertain type. There are therefore no known precedents to suggest that it was associated with the coin hoard and it is not certain whether the object is contemporary with the hoard. Given the amount of mixing of non-hoard coins with coins from the hoard, the association between this object and the coin hoard is also not definite. Therefore on the balance of probabilities this object was probably not directly associated with the coin hoard and therefore should not be regarded as treasure.Two copper-alloy objects with the 2007 addenda coins.  1 x undiagnostic lump of corroded copper alloy (12.61g) and 1 x corroded fragment, possibly a button, 0.40g. Association with the coin hoard is uncertain.SummaryCaligula (AD 37-41)\t\t\t1 Claudian copies\t\t\t3 Nero (AD 54-68)\t\t\t7 Vespasian (AD 69-79)\t\t12 Uncertain Flavian I (AD 69-81)\t22 Domitian (AD 81-96)\t\t\t13 Nerva\t(AD 96-8)\t\t\t1 Uncertain emperor\t\t\t15 Non-hoard coins\t\t\t7 Total\t\t\t\t\t81CATALOGUEall dupondii/asses unless marked (sest.) for sestertius after weightCALIGULA (1)No.\tObverse\tReverse\tBust\tBMC\tRIC\tQty\tWeight 1.\t\t- (head of Caligula l.)\t- S C (Vesta std. l.)\tZ\t46, 59, or 72\t38, 47, or 54\t1\t6.88*CLAUDIAN COPIES (3)No.\tObverse\tReverse\tBust\tBMC\tRIC\tQty\tWeight 2.\t\t- (head l.)\t- (Spes adv. l.)\tZ\t-\t-\t1\t7.63 (sest.)* 3.\t\t- (head l.)\t- (Minerva adv. r.)\tZ\t-\t-\t2\t3.66, 4.07NERO (7)Lyon (2)No.\tObverse\tReverse\tissue\tBust\tBMC\tRIC\tQty\tWeight 4.\t\tNERO CLAVD CAESAR AVG GER P M TR P IMP P P \tS C // DECVRSIO (Nero & soldier riding r.)\t3\tA1*\t312\t436\t1\t21.64 (sest.) 5.\t\tIMP NERO CAESAR AVG[...]P\tS C (Victory adv. l. holding shield marked SPQR)\t4/5\tA1+l\t?\t542 etc\t1\t8.41uncertain - Lyon or Rome (5)No.\tObverse\tReverse\tissue\tBust\tBMC\tRIC\tQty\tWeight 6.\t\t- (rad, head of Nero, l.)\tS C ...

      "CORONER'S REPORT13 Bronze Coins (sestertius) of Roman Date.Finders: Wrexhan Heritage Society Description of FindThis small group of second century AD copper alloy coins contains examples spanning the reigns of the emperors Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus and their families. (High degree of corrosion prevents close catalogue identification in many cases). The latest identifiable coin is for the deified Marcus Aurelius, probably produced very close to the time of his death in AD 180.Summary (all of the Roman brass denomination known as sestertii)Hadrian (AD 117-38) (1)Antoninus Pius (AD 138-61) (1)Faustina I (1)Marcus Aurelius (AD 161-80) (1)Faustina II (1)Lucilla (1)Commodus (AD 180-92) -Divus Marcus (1)Uncertain emperor (6)Total 13DiscussionThis pattern fits well with that which might be expected for a hoard of Roman coins deposited late in the second century AD with older, more worn, issues stretching back over previous reigns.CatalogueHADRIAN (1)1.

      "A hoard of 2000+ coins of Decentius and Magnetoius c353 AD Fel Temp ReparatoDescription of the coinsThis group consists of 2,896 coins and two coin fragments made in the fourth century AD. In fact all but 4 were produced in the AD 340s and 350s. Each coin, generally known today as a nummus,is predominantly copper-alloy with a tiny admixture of silver. The legends on the reverse of the nummi of AD 348-50 invariably read FEL(ix) TEMP(orum) REPARATIO which can be translated as 'happy times are here again' ('FTR' on summary). It was an optimistic hope prompted by the year 348 coinciding with the 1,100th anniversary of the traditional founding of Rome and the belief that it marked the beginning of a new age for the embattled empire. The plentiful earlier coinage of the century prior to AD 348 is largely absent here and this is generally the case with previously recorded 'Fel Temp' hoards.[1]  Discussion Three main groups are present. The first was produced during AD 348-50, the joint reign of Constantius II (AD 337-61) and his younger brother Constans (AD 337-50). Both had been brought up as Christians by their father Constantine the Great (AD 306-37) the first emperor to adopt the faith. Constans was the last legitimate emperor to visit Britain. The second consists of issues of the half-British usurper Magnentius who eliminated Constans and briefly made himself emperor of the west until defeated by the surviving brother. Shortly after Magnentius's downfall Constantius again reformed the coinage which had the effect of removing the usurper's coins from circulation. The assemblage just stretches into this third, post-Magnentian period. Although there are many reasons for the abandonment of hoards, it is possible that these coins quickly became useless or, worse still, represented an unwanted association with a discredited regime.From the same find? Chronologically the coins belong to one coinage system and form a discrete compositional group of coins that would have been briefly current in Britain around the middle of the fourth century AD. Copper alloy ring and pottery fragments found with the coins by Dr R. Hobbs1. Copper-alloy ring: plain ring of circular section, pockmarked surface, dark green patina. Ext. d.: 30.7mm Int. d.: 23.4mm Wt.: 7g. Function is uncertain, possibly a belt fitting. Date: probably ancient, Iron Age to Roman or later. Although this item could be associated with the coin hoard, it could also be a stray find. 2. Large number of pottery sherds of a coarseware jar: 10 rim sherds, 1 base and c. 140 body sherds similar to Servern Valley wares of orangey-pink coarseware from a round bodied jar with an everted rim. A number of pieces have traces of green copper corrosion on their inner surface, the result of contact with the coins. Date: late Roman, probably made in the Severn Valley (kiln site not identified).",

      "Report by Richard Abdy, Department of Coins & Medals, The British Museum.1 AE sestertius and 50 AE dupondii / asses to AD 96 (+ one cu-alloy object and 5 non-hoard coins) BM ref.: Treasure case no. 2006 T409 (disclaimed).Circumstances of discovery The entire find came from a 20m radius within the ploughsoil.Note Although it contains a high number illegible or part-legible coins this Flavian aes hoard shows the usual characteristics of D. R. Walker's 'period of sporadic supply' of base metal coinage to Britain in the first century. Claudian copies, Lyon mint bronze AD 64-67 (reign of Nero), AD 71-73 and 77-78 (Vespasian), and Rome mint bronze of AD 86-87 (Domitian). The latest accurately datable coin is of 87 (Domitian COS XIII).Non-hoard coins Although four late Roman coins (three certainly Valentinianic nummi) were found alongside they are probably intrusive to the current case and they might even be addenda to the Shorwell I (1932) find (RBCH 1382) with was not reported in detail but was a hoard of 22 fourth century coins including 'four of the Valentinianic dynasty'.Deposition ??? Because of the highly corroded condition of the coins only digital images of 2, 3, 7, 11, 17-19 were taken at the British Museum.The Cu-alloy object by Jody Joy Length: 45mm Weight: 9.8g Description: Hollow conical shaped object. Tapers to a rounded point at one end. There are striations running in straight lines along the object and traces of decoration at the un-tapered end. Summary: An un-diagnostic copper-alloy object.

Victory left AD 98 - 117Age and metal-content These three silver coins were found in close proximity to one another and are all silver denarii of Trajan (produced AD 98-117). It is therefore likely that they were deposited together in antiquity as all or part of a small coin hoard.In terms of their age and number they satisfy the criteria of the Treasure Act. As the coins contain well in excess of the 10% precious metal content, this group should be considered as a prima facie case of treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act (1996).",
